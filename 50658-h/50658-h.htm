<p class="drop-capi">ONCE upon a time there
was a King who reigned
over a country as yet,
for a reason you may
learn later on, undiscovered—a most
lovely country, full of green dales and
groves of oak, a land of dappled
meadows and sweet rivers, a green
cup in a circlet of mountains, in
whose shadow the grass was greenest;
and the only road to enter the country
lay up steep, boiling waterfalls, and
thereafter through rugged passes, the
channels that the rivers had cut for
themselves. Therefore, as you may
imagine, the dwellers in the land were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
little troubled by inroads of hostile
nations; and they lived peaceful lives,
managing their own affairs, and troubling
little about the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Now this King, like many kings
before and after him, had a daughter
who, while very young, had, I am
sorry to say, been very self-willed;
and the King, on the death of his
wife, finding himself utterly unable to
manage the Princess, handed her over
to the care of an aged nurse, who, however,
was not much more successful—but
that is neither here nor there.</p>

<p>For years everything went on
smoothly, and it seemed as if everything
intended to go on smoothly
until doomsday, in which case this
history would probably never have
been written. But one evening in
summer the Princess and her nurse,
who had by this time become less
able than ever to manage her charge,
sat on a terrace facing the west. The
Princess had been amusing herself by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
pelting the swans swimming in the
river with rose-leaves, which the indignant
swans snapped up as they
fluttered down on the air or floated
by on the river.</p>

<p>But after a time she began to tire
of this pastime, and sitting down,
looked at the sun that was just setting,
a blinding glare of orange flame
behind the black hills. Suddenly she
turned to the nurse and said:</p>

<p>‘What’s on the other side of the
hills?’</p>

<p>‘Lawk-a-mussy-me, miss!’ answered
the nurse, ‘I’m sure I don’t know.
What a question to ask!’</p>

<p>‘Then why don’t you ask some
one who has been there?’</p>

<p>‘Because no one ever has, miss.’</p>

<p>‘But why not?’</p>

<p>‘Because there’s a fiery serpent
that eats every one who comes near
the hills; and if you’re not eaten
up, you’re bound to tumble down a
precipice that’s nearly three miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
deep, before you can get over the
hills.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, what fun! Let’s go,’ said the
Princess, by no means awed. But
the nurse shook her head.</p>

<p>‘No, miss, I won’t go; and I’m
sure your pa won’t let you go.’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes, he will; let’s go and ask
him.’</p>

<p>But at that moment a black shadow
came across the sun, and the swans,
with a terrified ‘honk, honk,’ darted
across the water to hide themselves
in the reeds on the other side of the
river, churning dark tracks in the
purple of the sunlit water’s glassy
calmness.</p>

<p>‘Oh dear! oh dear! it’s a boggles,
and it’s coming this way,’ cried the
nurse.</p>

<p>‘But what is a boggles, nurse?’</p>

<p>‘Oh dear, it’s coming! Come into
the house and I’ll tell you—come.’</p>

<p>‘Not until you tell me what a
boggles is.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>The nurse perforce gave in.</p>

<p>‘A boggles is a thing with a hooked
beak and a squeaky voice, with hair
like snakes in corkscrews; and it
haunts houses and carries off things;
and when it once gets in it never
leaves again—oh dear, it’s on us!
Oh-h-h!’</p>

<p>Her cries only made the thing see
them sooner. It was only an eagle,
not a boggles; but it was on the
look-out for food, and the sun shining
on the Princess’s hair had caught its
eyes, and in spite of the cries of the
nurse it swooped down, and, seizing
the Princess in its claws, began to
carry her off. The nurse, however,
held on to her valiantly, screaming
all the while for help; but the eagle
had the best of it after all, for it
carried up, not only the Princess, but
the nurse also.</p>

<p>The nurse held on to her charge
for some seconds, but finding the
attempt useless she let go her hold;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
and since it happened that at the
moment they were over the river, she
fell into it with a great splash, and
was drifted on shore by the current.</p>

<p>Thus the Princess was carried off;
and although the land far and wide
was searched, no traces of her were
discoverable. You may imagine for
yourself what sorrow and rage the
King indulged in. He turned the
nurse off without warning, and even,
in a paroxysm of rage, kicked one
of his pages downstairs; nevertheless
that did not bring back the
Princess.</p>

<p>As a last resource he consulted
a wise woman (ill-natured people
called her a witch) who lived near
the palace. But the witch could only
say that the Princess would return
some day, but she couldn’t or wouldn’t
say when, even though the King
threatened to burn her. So it was
all of no use, and the King was,
and remained, in despair. But,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
since his Majesty is not the important
personage in the story, we may as
well leave him and return to the
Princess.</p>

<p>She, as you can think, was not
particularly happy or comfortable, for
the claws of the eagle pinched her,
and besides, she was very frightened;
for, you see, she didn’t know that it
wasn’t a boggles, as the nurse had
called it, and a boggles is a great
deal worse than the worst eagle ever
invented.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the eagle continued
flying straight towards the sun, which
was getting lower and lower, so that
by the time they reached the mountains
it was dark altogether. But the
eagle didn’t seem at all afraid of the
darkness, and just went on flying as
if nothing had happened, until suddenly
it let the Princess down on a
rock—at least, that was what it seemed
to her to be. Not knowing what else
to do, she sat where the eagle had let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
her fall, for she remembered something
about the precipice three miles deep,
and she did not at all wish to tumble
down that.</p>

<p>She expected that the eagle would
set to and make a meal off her at
once. But somehow or other, either
it had had enough to eat during the
day, or else did not like to begin to
have supper so late for fear of nightmare;
at any rate, it abstained, and
that was the most interesting matter
to her. Everything was so quiet
around that at last, in spite of herself,
she fell asleep. She slept quite
easily until daylight, although the
hardness of the rock was certainly
somewhat unpleasant. When she
opened her eyes it was already light,
and the sun at her back was darting
black shadows of the jagged mountains
on to the shimmering gray sea of mist
that veiled the land below. Her first
thought was naturally of the eagle,
and she did not need to look very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
far for him, since he was washing
himself in a little pool close by, keeping
an eye on her the while.</p>

<p>As soon as he saw her move he
gave himself a final shake, so that
the water flew all around, sparkling
in the sunlight; after which he came
towards her by hops until he was
quite close—rather too close, she
thought. Nevertheless she did not
move, having heard somewhere that,
under the circumstances, that is the
worst thing to do; she also remembered
animals cannot stand being
looked at steadily by the human eye,
therefore she looked very steadfastly
at the eyes of the eagle. But the
remedy did not seem to work well
in this case, for the glassy yellow
eyes of the bird looked bad-tempered,
and it winked angrily, seeming to say,
‘Whom are you staring at?’ And
then it began to stretch out its bill
towards her until it was within a
few inches of her face. This was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
more than she could stand, and she
said sharply, ‘Take your head away.’</p>

<p>The eagle, however, took no notice
whatever of this; and seeing nothing
better to do, she lifted up her hand
and gave it a smart box on the ear,
or rather on the place where its ear
should have been. The eagle drew
back its beak in a hurry and scratched
its head with one claw as if it were
puzzled. After a moment’s reflection
it put out its head again, and once
more the Princess lifted up her hand;
but when the eagle saw that it jumped
backwards in a hurry, as if it did not
care to receive a second box on the
ear, and began to stride sulkily away
as if it thought it better to wait a
while. When it reached the edge of
the rock—for I have forgotten to tell
you that they were on a flat rock at
the top of a mountain—it sat preening
its feathers in a sulky manner,
as if it imagined itself a very ill-used
bird; moreover, although it seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
inclined to remain there a long time,
I need not tell you that the Princess
had no objections. However, after
a time even the waiting began to
grow unpleasant; but suddenly a
peculiar sound, as of something shooting
through the air, came from below,
and the eagle gave a leap and fell
down a mass of tumbled feathers
with an arrow quivering in their
centre, and, with hardly a shudder,
it was dead.</p>

<p>The Princess, as you may imagine,
was a good deal startled by this sudden
occurrence, but I cannot say she was
very sorry for the eagle; on the contrary,
she was rather glad to be rid
of him, and it suddenly came into
her head that the man who had shot
the arrow might possibly be somewhere
below, and in that case might
come up and save her if she called
to him. So she tried to get up, but
she was so stiff that she could hardly
move, and when she did stand up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
she had pins and needles in one of
her feet, and had to stamp hard on
the ground before it would go away.
So that it was some time before she
got to the edge and looked over.
Now it happened that, just as she
bent carefully forward to look down
the side, the head of a man appeared
over the edge, and his hands were
so near her that he almost caught
hold of her foot as he put them up
to help himself. As she drew back
a little to let him have room, he
suddenly noticed her, and almost let
go his hold in astonishment.</p>

<p>‘Hullo, little girl,’ he said; ‘how
did you come here? It’s rather early
in the morning for you to be up. But
who are you when you’re at home?’</p>

<p>‘I’m the daughter of King Caret.’</p>

<p>‘King how much?’</p>

<p>‘King Caret, I said; and I should
be glad if you would help me down
from this height, and show me the
way back.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>‘How on earth can I show you
the way back when I don’t know who
King Caret is?’</p>

<p>‘But surely you must know who
he is?’</p>

<p>‘Never heard of him. What’s he
like, and what’s he king of?’</p>

<p>‘He’s the King of Aoland.’</p>

<p>‘And where’s Aoland?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know—it’s somewhere over
those mountains—the eagle brought
me here, you know.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! the eagle brought you here,
did he? It’s a little habit he’s got;
he’s carried off no end of my kids
and young sheep, so I suppose he
thought he’d try a change and carry
off one of King Turnip—I mean
Caret’s. But if he brought you
from over the mountains you won’t
get back in a hurry, I can tell
you; you’d have to jump up a
precipice three miles high, and then
you’d be eaten by old Kinchof the
dragon.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Oh dear! then I shall never get
back!’</p>

<p>‘No, I’m afraid you won’t. But
don’t begin to cry now—there, there—and
I’ll take you to King Mumkie;
he’s the king of this country, you
know.’</p>

<p>‘What an awful name—Mumkie!’</p>

<p>‘Yes, it is rather unpleasant, isn’t it?
And then, he’s a usurper—he drove
the last king out and made himself
king instead. He used to be a
cat’s-meat man, but he got up an
army and drove the other off the
throne, and now <i>he’s</i> turned into a
gardener—his name’s Abbonamento.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, never mind what his name
is, only get me down—I’m awfully
hungry; for you see I’ve been up
here all night.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! all right. But I say, how
are you going to get down—you can’t
climb, can you?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know,’ she answered; ‘I’ve
never tried.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Then you can be sure you can’t.
The only thing seems to be for me
to carry you down.’</p>

<p>But the Princess did not seem to
relish the idea at all.</p>

<p>‘You might let me drop, you know;
it’s rather steep.’ And it was pretty
steep, too—about as steep as the wall
of a house, and a good deal higher
than a very high house. However,
it seemed to be the only thing to do,
so she let herself be carried down.
The man took her on one arm, and
yet seemed to climb down about as
easily as if he were going downstairs.
However, the Princess did not notice
that, since she kept her eyes shut
hard, for, to tell the truth, she was
rather nervous.</p>

<p>But at last they were at the bottom,
and he let her down on to the ground.</p>

<p>‘Now, what are you going to do?’
he said.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know at all. What can
I do?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>‘You’d better go and see King
Mumkie and ask him what to do.’</p>

<p>‘But he has got such a dreadful
name; it sounds as if he was awfully
ugly,’ she said.</p>

<p>‘But he’s not at all; he’s just
like me, and I’m sure I’m handsome
enough for any one.’</p>

<p>The Princess looked at him now
for the first time; for you see, she
had not noticed him very much
while she was on the mountain. But
now she could hardly repress a
shudder; for he was awfully ugly.
To begin with, he was big enough
for any giant, and then his hair was
of a purple hue, and his eyes of a
delicate sea-green that flashed in the
shade like a cat’s; and then his nose
was awfully red, and shaped like a
mangel-wurzel; and his teeth, which
were long and bright green, shone in
the sun like danger-signals. Altogether
he was not prepossessing; and the
Princess could hardly help smiling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
when he said that the King was as
handsome as himself. However, he
went on:</p>

<p>‘My name’s Wopole; I’m King
Mumkie’s falconer, and so I can tell
you all about him. Come, let’s go
towards the town.’</p>

<p>And as there seemed nothing else to
do, she set out with him; but he walked
so fast that she could hardly keep up.</p>

<p>‘How slowly you do walk!’ he
grumbled in a bad-tempered manner;
‘can’t you keep up? Come along,
I can’t wait all day.’ And he went
on faster than ever, so that she had
to run to keep up with him. Suddenly
he stopped as if he had been shot.</p>

<p>‘Confound it, I’ve forgotten to bring
the eagle, and I shall have to go all
the way back and get it. Oh—ouch!’
And he began to howl in such a
dreadful manner that the Princess
felt quite relieved when he turned
and ran towards the hill at the top
of his speed, howling all the way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>‘What on earth shall I do now?’
thought the Princess. ‘If I wait for
this dreadful giant, goodness knows
what may happen, and then his king
has such an unpleasant name; at any
rate, I should like some breakfast, for
I’m awfully hungry. I think I’ll go
on towards the town, and see if I can’t
find some one who’ll show me the way
home.’</p>

<p>So she went on down the lane for
some way, until, coming to a place
where a stream went across the path,
she knelt down and scooped up a little
water in the palm of her hand and
drank it; for, you see, the sun was
very hot now, and the heat made her
throat feel quite dry and parched.
When she had finished she went and
lay down in the long grass that bordered
the road, for she was rather
tired. She intended to wait till some
one came along, only she was quite
resolved not to go with the giant at
any rate. So she lay quietly in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
shade listening to the loud humming
of the bees and the chirp of a linnet
that was pluming itself, swinging on
a bough above her head.</p>

<p>She had not been waiting long
before she heard a dreadful noise
behind her coming down the road,
and in a few minutes she recognised
the voice of the giant, who seemed
to be in a terrible temper. Gradually
the sound of his voice and his footsteps
came nearer. The Princess did
not know what to do, for if she tried
to run away he would only catch her
up; so she lay perfectly still, hoping
he would pass her without seeing her.
And that is just what did happen;
for, in a few moments, he came rushing
round the corner shouting out,
‘Stop! stop! will you?’ And as his
eyes were fixed on the road far in
advance, of course he did not notice
her, and was soon round another
bend in the road. The Princess
noticed that he had the eagle hanging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
with its claws round his neck, and
the jolting, as he went by, had shaken
one of its large tail feathers out, and
as soon as she had got over her fright,
she went and picked it up out of the
dusty road.</p>

<p>Just as she picked it up, the clatter
of feet running along the road came
to her ears, and for a moment she
feared that the giant had returned;
but soon a cow trotted round the
bend and stopped at the stream to
drink, presently another, and then a
third. Each of them took a long
look at the Princess, and then bent
down its head to take a draught out
of the stream. Just then an old man
came round the corner, and when he
saw the cows had stopped he called
out:</p>

<p>‘Gee on, Lightfoot; now, Daisy;
come up, Cherry,’ and the cows gave
their heads a toss, and walked slowly
through the stream.</p>

<p>The Princess hurried to one side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
of the road, for, like many people,
she had an instinctive dread of anything
like a cow or a bull.</p>

<p>The old man noticed it and smiled.</p>

<p>‘Oh, you needn’t be afraid, miss,
they won’t hurt you,’ he said; but
all the same, she didn’t care to go
too near them. ‘They’ve just been
frightened by Wopole, King Mumkie’s
falconer,’ he went on. ‘Wopole came
running round the corner suddenly,
and almost knocked Lightfoot—that’s
the dun cow—over. He was roaring
out “Where is she?” awfully loud.
I pity her when he gets her, whoever
she is.’</p>

<p>‘But who is <i>she?</i>’ asked the Princess.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know—how should I?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I only thought you might
know. But what will he do with her
when he gets her?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know; fry her in lard or
something—that’s what they generally
do to strangers in the town now.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Oh dear!’ said the Princess; ‘how
am I to get away from him?’</p>

<p>The old man looked at her curiously.</p>

<p>‘Oh! you’re her,’ he said.</p>

<p>‘I rather think I am. But how am
I to get away?’ she answered.</p>

<p>‘If you’ll come with me I’ll take
you to my cottage over there, and
they’ll never think of looking for you
there.’</p>

<p>But the Princess did not exactly
like the idea.</p>

<p>‘Aren’t you one of these people?’
she asked; ‘because I don’t relish being
fried in lard, or oil, or anything else.’</p>

<p>But the old man shook his head.</p>

<p>‘Good gracious me, no!’ he said.
‘I wouldn’t let them roast the last
stranger that came to the town, and
so they turned me out.’</p>

<p>‘Oh,’ said the Princess, ‘then you
must be King Abominable.’</p>

<p>‘I am Abbonamento.’</p>

<p>‘Then I suppose I shall be safe
with you?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Quite safe, if you like to come;
only just help me to drive the cows.’
And the old man called to his animals
who were browsing in the grass at the
wayside, and they trudged quietly on
till they came to a gate in the hedge.
This they waited for the old man
to open for them, and then went
through the meadow until they came
to a little farmhouse half hidden by
trees.</p>

<p>‘This is my house,’ the King said.
‘Just wait a moment till I have put
the cows in the byre, and then I’ll
come back and let you in; for you
see my wife’s away at the market, and
there’s no one else at home.’</p>

<p>So the Princess stopped where she
was, and the old man went whistling
round to the back of the house driving
his cows before him.</p>

<p>It was a very small house, with the
thatched roof coming so low down
that you could touch it almost with
your hand, and the windows were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
quite overshadowed by it. Over a
little arbour of trellis-work before the
door ran a rose-tree of deep red
flowers, and the roses were full of
bees that came from the hives arranged
on benches under the eaves, and a
few chickens were asleep on one leg
under the porch.</p>

<p>In two or three minutes the door
opened, and the old man appeared,
and the chickens walked lazily away.</p>

<p>‘I entered by a back door,’ he
explained. ‘Come in and make yourself
at home.’</p>

<p>The inside of the house was just as
small and homely as the outside, and
the rooms were refreshingly shady and
cool after the hot sunlight without.</p>

<p>‘Sit down,’ said the old man, pointing
to an arm-chair; and the Princess
did as she was told.</p>

<p>‘Now,’ said he, ‘if you will tell me
where you come from, I will try to find
out how to take you back.’</p>

<p>So she told him all her story, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
he listened very attentively. When she
had finished he said:</p>

<p>‘It’s lucky for you that Wopole forgot
the eagle, or goodness knows what
would have happened to you; but how
you’re to get back I don’t know. It’s
my opinion you never will, for no one
was ever known to pass those mountains
safely yet.’</p>

<p>I don’t know what else he would
have gone on to say, but by this
time the Princess had begun to cry
bitterly.</p>

<p>‘Oh dear me!’ said the old man,
‘what a fool I was to go and tell her
all that. Now goodness knows what’ll
happen. Oh dear, oh dear, Princess,
don’t go on weeping like that, or you’ll
melt altogether; do leave off.’</p>

<p>But the Princess did not seem at all
inclined to leave off, and she might
have melted altogether, only just then
the door opened, and an old woman
with a market-basket on her arm and
a big umbrella in her hand came into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the room, but stood transfixed with
her eyes and mouth wide open when
she saw the Princess.</p>

<p>‘My! Abbonamento, what’s the little
girl crying for? and where does she
come from? and what does it all
mean?’</p>

<p>And she picked up her umbrella,
which she had dropped, and leaned it
against the table, and put her market-basket
on a chair. This she did very
slowly, and all the while the old king
was telling her what had happened, so
that by the time she had finished her
preparations she knew nearly as much
about it as he did. When he had
finished she shook her head.</p>

<p>‘Poor girl! poor girl! So you
come from the land on the other side
of the mountains. I know it.’</p>

<p>The Princess had by this time left
off crying, and when she heard the old
lady say ‘I know it’ she said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘“Kennst du das Land</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wo die Citronen blühen?”’</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>But the old lady shook her head.</p>

<p>‘That’s Greek, and I never could
understand Greek. If it had been
German or French now—but just
translate it for me, will you?’</p>

<p>So the Princess translated it for
her.</p>

<div class="hang1">‘“Knowest thou the land where blooms the lemon-flower?”’</div>

<p>But the old lady shook her head.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know so much about the
lemon-flower; but my grand-aunt
Thompson had a sister whose daughter
had a servant who’d seen the dragon
eat up the last man that ever tried to
cross the mountains.’</p>

<p>‘But I don’t see how that is to help
me to get back—do you?’</p>

<p>‘No, I don’t exactly; but perhaps
something will turn up to help you.
Won’t it, Abbonamento?’</p>

<p>Abbonamento nodded.</p>

<p>‘But what shall I do in the meanwhile?’
said the Princess; ‘for, you see,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
I don’t want to be fried in lard, as you
say the townsmen are in the habit of
doing.’</p>

<p>‘You’d better stop with us,’ said
Abbonamento. ‘Eh, wife, what do you
say?’</p>

<p>And his wife said:</p>

<p>‘Oh yes, certainly; it’s the only
thing to do. Do stop.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I suppose I must,’ said the
Princess. ‘Only, shan’t I be rather in
the way?’</p>

<p>But the King answered:</p>

<p>‘Oh, not at all, quite the other way.
You’ll be very useful. You can milk
the cows, and pluck the fowls, and feed
the pigs, and all sorts of things.’</p>

<p>‘But what will the people of the
town say if they see me?’ asked the
Princess.</p>

<p>‘The people of the town—oh, they
never come near me, although they are
glad to buy butter and milk and eggs
of me in the market. They think it
seems grand to say they buy their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
things of a king; but they never
trouble about me at all except for
that.’</p>

<p>Just at this moment the old lady,
thinking it her turn to say something,
said:</p>

<p>‘By the bye, you have not told us
your name yet.’</p>

<p>‘Would you like it in full, or only
what I’m generally called?’ asked the
Princess.</p>

<p>‘Oh, say it in full, unless you’ve
any objection.’</p>

<p>‘Well, you see, it’s rather long; it
generally takes about a quarter of an
hour to say, only if you want it particularly
I’ll tell you.’</p>

<p>But the Queen answered:</p>

<p>‘Ah! well, perhaps we’ll wait for a
time, until we’ve got leisure to listen
to it. Meanwhile you might tell us
what the short of it is.’</p>

<p>‘They generally call me the Princess
Ernalie. Now you might tell me your
name, if you don’t mind.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>‘They generally call me Queen
Araminta. If you like, and are not
too tired, I’ll show you the farm, and
then we’ll have dinner.’</p>

<p>So the Princess went through the
yard to the cows’ byre, and from the
stalls to the pig-sties, and from the
sties to the poultry-run, and thence
to the orchard, and from the orchard
to the flower-garden, and after that home
again.</p>

<p>So it was arranged that the Princess
Ernalie was to stop with the King and
Queen until something should turn up.
But nothing ever did turn up, and
the days lengthened into months, and
the months into years, and still she
stayed with the old couple; and as
time went on she seemed to do almost
all the work of the farm, for the
old King and Queen were beginning
to get too old and weak for hard
work. And gradually she began to
forget about her native land, and it
seemed as if the farm were to be her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
home for ever. And every year she
grew taller and more beautiful; but
that’s a habit that princesses have
pretty often. So five years passed
quietly away, and nothing seemed likely
to disturb the peace of the household.</p>

<p>Every morning regularly she got up
at five o’clock to drive the cows to
the pasture, and then she fed the
poultry, and, if it happened to be a
Thursday or Saturday, she went with
the Queen to take the butter and eggs
to market; besides which she had to
milk the cows and cook the dinner,
and all sorts of things, so that she
was gradually turning into a simple
country maid.</p>

<p>During all the five years no one
from the town ever came near the
house, and so you may imagine how
surprised she was one morning when
she got up and opened her bedroom
window to see a man coming across
the clover-field towards the house.
She watched him come right up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the door, and then, when she heard
him knock, ran down to tell the
King and Queen that a man was
knocking at the door.</p>

<p>‘Who on earth can it be?’ asked
Abbonamento.</p>

<p>‘It’s not the tax-collector, is it?’
asked Araminta.</p>

<p>‘Oh no, it’s not him; he’s an old
man, and this one is quite young,’
answered the Princess.</p>

<p>‘Nor the water-man?’</p>

<p>‘No, it’s not him either. There
he is knocking again.’</p>

<p>Indeed, the knocking was becoming
quite furious.</p>

<p>‘He’s a very impatient young man,
whoever he is,’ said Abbonamento.
‘You’d better go and tell him not
to make such a noise. Let him in—be
quick, or he’ll knock the door
down!’</p>

<p>And it seemed so likely, that Ernalie
ran down as fast as she could
and opened the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Why can’t you open the door
faster?’ said an angry voice; and
then Ernalie saw a young man looking
at her in a state of great surprise.
‘Why, who are you?’ he asked.
‘Is this not the house of their Majesties
King Abbonamento and Queen
Araminta?’</p>

<p>‘They used to be King and Queen
at one time,’ answered Ernalie.</p>

<p>‘They ought to be now,’ said the
young man with a frown.</p>

<p>‘That’s quite another thing,’ retorted
Ernalie.</p>

<p>‘Oh, is it?’ said he, with a smile
this time. ‘But who on earth are
you, if I may ask?’</p>

<p>‘I am Her Royal Highness Princess
Ernalie of Aoland; and who on earth
are you, if I may ask?’</p>

<p>‘I am Prince Treblo of this country,’
answered he.</p>

<p>‘I suppose you are the son of King
Mumkie, then?’ said she.</p>

<p>‘Good gracious, no!’ said the Prince.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>The Princess was just about to say,
‘Then whose son are you?’ when the
old King burst into the room. He
had evidently got up in a hurry, and
he was only attired in his flowered
dressing-gown.</p>

<p>‘My long-lost chee-yld!’ he exclaimed,
as he threw himself into the
stranger’s arms. ‘Araminta! Araminta!
come along, it’s Treblo.’</p>

<p>And the Queen came rushing down
in haste, as you may imagine. Over
the rest of this affecting scene we
will draw a curtain—that’s what they
generally do with affecting scenes—in
books, at least.</p>

<p>The Princess Ernalie easily perceived
that she was a little—as the
French say—<i>de trop;</i> that is, finding
that ‘three was company and four
none.’ So she left the room and
went upstairs to comb her hair and
wash her face and hands, and make
herself look smart generally; for she
thought that would be only right on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the day on which the eldest son of
the house came home—especially as
he was very handsome.</p>

<p>Now it happened that as she was
bending down to pick up her best
shoes from under her toilet-table, one
of them had gone a little far back,
and as she drew it out she noticed
that something lay behind the shoe,
and she drew that out too. You
may perhaps remember that she had
picked up out of the road an eagle’s
feather which Wopole had let fall as
he hurried by with the eagle on
his back. Well, then, it was this
feather that she now drew out from
under the toilet-table. It had lain
there since she had first entered the
room five years ago. Now this
doesn’t say much for the cleanliness
of the floors, but in those unsophisticated
days they never thought of
sweeping any hidden spot in the
floor. This habit, curiously enough,
survives even now among some people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
However, to return to the Princess
Ernalie.</p>

<p>When she picked up the feather
she stood upright again and examined
it carefully.</p>

<p>‘Why, how nice,’ she said. ‘It’s
the old eagle’s feather. Now that’ll
come in handy; my hat rather wanted
a new feather, and it’ll just suit the
colour of my hair and eyes.’</p>

<p>So she went to the looking-glass
and held the feather close against her
hair. But to her astonishment nothing
was to be seen in the glass—not a
vestige of herself; it seemed as if
she had vanished altogether.</p>

<p>‘Why, what’s the matter with the
glass?’ she said. ‘Something seems
to have gone wrong with it.’ So she
put the feather on the table and went
to rub the glass, but when she looked
at it she was there all right again.</p>

<p>‘That’s queer,’ she thought; ‘I can’t
have been right in front of the glass.’
So she took up the feather and went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
in front of the glass. This time she
saw herself very well, but as soon
as the feather touched her hair she
vanished just as before.</p>

<p>‘Good gracious!’ she said; ‘what
is the matter with the glass?’ So
she tried again, and the result was
always the same—whenever the feather
touched her hair she vanished. ‘It
must be something the matter with
the feather.’ So she examined it
quite closely, and she found rolled
round the quill end of it a small piece
of paper on which was written:</p>

<p>‘Guard well the feather, for whoso
toucheth his hair therewith—though he
be but feather-brained—shall be invisible,
yet shall he see all.’</p>

<p>Ernalie read it over once or twice
from beginning to end.</p>

<p>‘The writing says “his” hair; but
it seems to act just as well with “her”
hair—that is, my hair. What fun I
shall have now. I think I’ll try it on
at once on the King. But then, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
might frighten him. No, I’ll wait, and
try it on Treblo; and that reminds me
I think that they’ve had enough of it
all to themselves now. I’ll go and see
if I can do anything for them.’ So
she locked the feather up in one of
the drawers, and then, putting on her
shoes, went downstairs.</p>

<p>Now it happened that just as she
had almost reached the bottom step
her heel came out of her shoe, and as
she stopped to put it firmly on again
she heard the voice of the stranger
saying:</p>

<p>‘By the bye, mother, who was that
girl who opened the door to me?’</p>

<p>‘Oh! that’s Ernalie,’ answered the
Queen’s voice.</p>

<p>(It seemed as if the shoe took some
time to get on again.)</p>

<p>‘So she told me; but who is
Ernalie?’ he asked again.</p>

<p>‘Oh! you’d better get her to tell
you that too when she comes down.
Well, what do you think of her?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Oh, she’s—she’s just lovely,’ answered
he.</p>

<p>(‘Listeners never hear any good of
themselves,’ thought the Princess.
However, the shoe had come on just
at that moment, and she entered the
room.)</p>

<p>‘Speak of the—ahem!’ the King
was just saying, when the Prince interrupted
him.</p>

<p>‘“Speak of angels, and you hear
the rustling of their wings,” you mean,’
he said.</p>

<p>‘Thank you for the compliment, if it
was meant for me,’ said the Princess.</p>

<p>‘Oh! don’t mention it—it’s nothing
when you’re used to it,’ said Treblo, who,
to tell the truth, seemed rather confused.</p>

<p>‘And are you used to calling young
ladies angels?’ said his father sharply.
‘I suppose it’s some of the foreign
manners you’ve learnt.’</p>

<p>‘Suppose we change the subject,’
retorted his son, and the subject was
changed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Ernalie retired again. She wanted
to look after the dinner, so that it
might not be late, and so nothing else
in particular happened, for Treblo
went round the farm with his father,
and Araminta went into the kitchen
to help Ernalie with the dinner. When
the goose was turning on the spit, and
the apple-tart had been put into the
oven, the Princess had time to ask
some questions about Treblo, and the
Queen told her that he had been sent
out of the way by Mumkie, in order
that he might not attempt to put his
father on the throne again; but after
seven years he had come back safe,
having had all sorts of adventures, and
he now felt quite confident that he
would be able to restore his father,
for he was very popular with the army
that had just returned from the war,
and as to the people of the town, they
cared very little who was king—in
fact, they rather preferred Abbonamento
to Mumkie. So Araminta was quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
cheerful over it, for she much preferred
living in a palace to living in a
cottage.</p>

<p>Things went merrily through the
day, and at dinner-time they drank
the health of the King and Queen of
the country, and altogether they seemed
very happy. After dinner the King
composed himself for his afternoon
nap, and the Queen took down a
volume of sermons and began to read.
Ernalie went out to milk the cows and
take the eggs from the hens’ nests.
As to the Prince, he said he was going
out to take a walk.</p>

<p>Before going out the Princess slipped
up to her room, and took the eagle’s
feather from the drawer where she had
locked it up. She intended to try if
she were invisible to the cows and
poultry. So she put it in her sunbonnet
and went out. It really seemed
as if it was quite correct about the
feather, for as soon as she got out of
the door a bee ran right against her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
and then a sparrow that was chirping
on a rail allowed her to catch hold
of it before it took any notice of her
approach. However, she let it go,
and it flew away, looking very astonished
indeed, as you may imagine.</p>

<p>She reached the pasture, and opened
the gate, calling to the cows:</p>

<p>‘Daisy, Daisy; come, Lightfoot;
Cherry, come!’</p>

<p>The cows looked up from the
ground, and came towards the gate,
looking very astonished indeed; but
when they got quite close and saw no
one they stopped, and however much
she called them they refused to move.</p>

<p>‘This will never do,’ she said; ‘I
must really let them see me, or they
won’t come.’</p>

<p>So she took the feather from her
bonnet, and called again. This time
the cows seemed quite ready to come,
and they trotted along to the gate and
crowded round her to be stroked. So
she shut the gate again and told the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
cows to go on—for they understood
her quite well—and then she went on
after them. When they got to the
dairy she milked them one after
the other as they came in their
regular order to the stool. She was
milking the last one—Cherry, the best
of them all—and she leaned her face
against its side, and listened to the
‘thud, thud,’ of the milk as it streamed
into the pail with a foam like the sea
in a rage. She was in fact almost
lulled to sleep by it, when she was
startled by a voice behind her. It
was so sudden that she almost upset
the milk-pail in her fright.</p>

<p>‘It seems to be easy work milking,’
said the voice, and she looked round
and saw it was the Prince, who had
come quietly up behind, and was leaning
over the fence at her back, looking
on lazily at her.</p>

<p>‘Oh! how you startled me, Prince,’
she said.</p>

<p>‘Did I?’ he answered. ‘I am very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
sorry for that; but you needn’t call me
Prince yet. I’m not a Prince, you see,
and then you’re the adopted daughter
of my parents, so you ought to call me
your brother.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, really!’ said she. ‘However,
you soon will be a Prince, and then I
shan’t be able to call you brother,
shall I?’</p>

<p>‘Why not?’</p>

<p>‘Because you will be a Prince, and
I am only a dairymaid.’</p>

<p>‘But you’re a Princess, aren’t you?’
he asked.</p>

<p>‘I was a Princess once,’ she said,
with a sigh; ‘but——’</p>

<p>‘You shall be again,’ he said.</p>

<p>‘But how do you know?’ she
asked.</p>

<p>‘I know—oh, well, let’s change the
subject. As I said before, it seems to
be easy work milking. You might let
me try?’</p>

<p>But she said:</p>

<p>‘It wouldn’t be any good. Cherry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
wouldn’t let any one but me touch
her. Besides, I’ve just done, and
I’m going to carry the pails to the
house.’</p>

<p>‘Let me carry them for you?’ he
said quickly.</p>

<p>‘Oh, thanks; if you’ll take two, I’ll
take the other two, and thus we shall
do it all in one journey,’ she answered.</p>

<p>So he did as he was told, and the
pails were put safely in the house.</p>

<p>‘Now I must go and get the eggs,’
she said.</p>

<p>‘Can I be of any use?’ asked the
Prince.</p>

<p>But she answered:</p>

<p>‘Oh no, there’s nothing for you to
do, thanks.’</p>

<p>But he went with her all the same.
I suppose he thought he might be of
some use. So she let him hold the
basket for her, and the eggs were also
put safely in the house. Just, however,
as he had put them down,
a shrill whistle sounded twice from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
behind the garden hedge, and the
Prince said:</p>

<p>‘Oh, that’s a friend of mine.
You must excuse me for a few
moments,’ and he went towards the
hedge.</p>

<p>‘I wonder who his friend is,’ she
said to herself. ‘I think I’ll put
the feather on again and go after
them. It would be a good way of
trying my feather on men.’</p>

<p>So she took the feather out of her
pocket again, and put it in her bonnet,
and then ran after him. He had got
over the fence some time before she
reached it, but he was still in sight on
the other side, and with him his friend
was walking. He seemed to be a
soldier, so far as she knew. They
were talking very earnestly; but, from
where she was, she was not able to
hear what they said. So she too got
over the fence, and went towards
them; but she reached them rather
too late to hear anything much that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
they did say. What she did hear was
this, from the soldier:</p>

<p>‘Then you will come to-night at
half-past twelve?’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ answered the Prince.</p>

<p>‘We’ll have everything ready, and
it will be easily done. If I were you
I wouldn’t tell the King or Queen,
it would only make them nervous, and
we’re sure to succeed.’</p>

<p>‘Very well,’ said Treblo; ‘at half-past
twelve.’</p>

<p>(‘Half-past twelve,’ thought the Princess;
‘what on earth is he going to
do at that time of night? It sounds
funny. I think I’ll go with him to
look after him.’ For, you see, Ernalie
was rather inquisitive, as you may
have found out by this time.)</p>

<p>So the soldier went one way, and
Treblo went back to the house whistling
‘When the king shall enjoy his
own again.’</p>

<p>But the Princess ran on in front
of him and reached the house first,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
so that by the time he was there she
had taken the feather out of her
bonnet and was quite visible again.</p>

<p>He came in quite naturally, as if
nothing had happened, and the rest
of the day went off quietly enough.</p>

<p>They went very early to bed at
the farm, and the house was quiet
by half-past eight.</p>

<p>Just before they went to bed Ernalie
asked the Prince:</p>

<p>‘Do you like walking at night
much?’</p>

<p>‘It depends upon the night very
much,’ he answered.</p>

<p>‘Such a night as this, for instance,’
said she.</p>

<p>‘Oh yes—“a moonlight night for a
ramble,” don’t you know?’ he said,
laughing.</p>

<p>‘About half-past twelve, I suppose.’</p>

<p>The Prince looked astonished and
shocked.</p>

<p>‘Half-past twelve!’ he said, with his
eyes wide open; ‘why, I’m never out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
after eight. My mother says the night
air’s not good for me.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, is that it?’ said the Princess.
‘However, I’m tired; good-night.’
And she went to her room and lay
down on her bed with all her clothes
on. It was rather hard work keeping
awake for such a time, but at last she
heard the kitchen clock strike twelve,
and she knew it was twenty past. So
she got up as quietly as possible and
put on the feather, for, you see, she
didn’t want any one to see her. It
seemed very ghostly getting up so late
at night, and although she stepped
very lightly, the stairs creaked loudly.
She went into the sitting-room and sat
on a chair waiting for the Prince to
come down. She had to wait close on
half an hour; for, you see, the Prince
had heard the clock strike too, but
didn’t know it was twenty minutes
slow. However, at last he came downstairs
holding the candle in his hand.
He hadn’t put his boots on for fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of waking any one, and so he, too,
sat down on a chair to put them on.
This was rather unpleasant for the
Princess, for of course she had to keep
as quiet as a mouse for fear of making
him suspicious; for, you see, it was
so quiet that the least breath she took
could be heard. At last the putting
on of his boots was finished, and he
stood up, saying to himself out loud,
‘Now, where’s my hat?’ and then he
looked straight at the Princess and
said, ‘Ah, there it is,’ and he began
to walk towards her.</p>

<p>‘What can he want?’ thought the
Princess; and then she looked down
at the chair—for, you see, she could
see right through herself—and she
discovered she was sitting on his hat.
By this time he was quite close to
her and bending down to pick his
hat up, so she jumped sideways off
the chair as fast as she could; but
even then, as he put his hand out,
he caught hold of hers, which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
not time to get out of the way. As
soon as his hand closed on it, however,
he let go as if it had stung him.</p>

<p>‘Good gracious! what is that?’ he
said in astonishment. And he did
look so funny that she had hard work
to keep from laughing at him. However,
he calmed down in a minute,
and again tried to take up his hat.
This time you may be sure that the
Princess’s hand was no longer there,
for she had taken herself and it over
to the other side of the table. So
he took up the hat and looked
at it.</p>

<p>‘Looks as if it had been sat on,’
he muttered. ‘Just like ’em; people
always do sit on my hat if they can.’
However, he pushed it out straight
again and looked at his boots to see
if the laces were quite tight; and then
he blew the light out, seeming, by the
noise he was making, to be trying to
get out of the door. When she heard
him in the passage she thought it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
about time to follow him. So she
tried to do it, making as little noise
as possible; but although she did try
very hard she did not succeed very
well, for she fell right over a chair
and made noise enough to be heard
all over the house.</p>

<p>‘What on earth’s that?’ she heard the
Prince ask, and then he lit a match to
look. But he didn’t see anything, and
the light allowed the Princess to get
quite close to him without upsetting anything
more, and he opened the door,
letting the moonlight shine in clear and
white. While he was standing at the
door she managed to slip past him into
the open air, and there she waited
for him. He wasn’t very long coming,
and then she followed him down the
garden, keeping to the grassy edge,
and not walking on the path for fear
of the noise that her feet would make
on the gravel. They reached the field
and then the road, and the Prince was
joined by the other man whom the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Princess had seen before. This man—whom,
by the bye, the Prince called
Ablot—was dressed in complete
armour, and he carried another suit,
which the Prince proceeded to put
on.</p>

<p>(‘This begins to look exciting,’
thought Ernalie. ‘Perhaps he’s a
highwayman, or a footpad—anyhow,
I mean to keep up with them.’)</p>

<p>So she walked on faster, for she had
fallen a little behind. When she got
up with them she heard the Prince
say:</p>

<p>‘Well, we’ll surround the Palace,
take Mumkie prisoner, and turn him
into the market-gardener; and then
we’ll proclaim it to the rest of the
citizens that my father and mother are
King and Queen once more, and if
they won’t give in—so much the worse
for them. The soldiers are all on my
side.’</p>

<p>The other answered:</p>

<p>‘Oh, but they’ll give in without the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
soldiers. They’re not at all fond of
Mumkie. He has made himself very
unpopular of late. You see, he put
a farthing on the income tax, and he’s
raised the price of everything that
begins with “S,” like “sausages” and
“sealing-wax” and “soap” and “sewing-machines.”
Now your father only raised
the price of things that begin with “Z,”
and there aren’t many “Z’s,” you know;
there’s “zebras” and “zeal,” and you
can’t make much out of selling zeal.’</p>

<p>(‘Ah, that’s what you’re up to!’
thought the Princess. ‘We ought to
have some fun then.’)</p>

<p>However, they were walking too fast
for her to think much. All she could
do was to keep up, and that she did
to the best of her power, until at last
they reached the middle of the town,
where the King’s Palace stood. Here
they halted to take counsel.</p>

<p>‘You wait here while I go and fetch
the men,’ said Ablot, and as the Prince
made no objection, he went and left him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
standing in the moonlit square. As
Ablot seemed gone rather a long time,
the Princess thought she would have a
little fun, and going close to the Prince
she whispered in his ear:</p>

<p>‘Does your mother know you’re
out?’</p>

<p>The Prince turned round once or
twice, as if to assure himself that there
was no one hiding behind his back;
but as he could see no one, he simply
said:</p>

<p>‘I beg your pardon.’</p>

<p>‘That’s very good of you; but I
thought you were never allowed out
after half-past eight o’clock. I heard
you tell Ernalie so this evening. I’m
afraid you told a fib.’</p>

<p>The Prince looked very astonished.</p>

<p>‘Who or what are you?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘Never you mind. I’ve a good
mind not to let you succeed this
evening, because you deceive not only
your old mother who is asleep at
home, but you have also told a fib<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
to that innocent girl, of whom I’m
very fond.’ (‘That’s quite true,’ thought
the Princess. ‘I’m very fond of myself.’
And so she was.)</p>

<p>The Prince looked astonished.</p>

<p>‘How on earth could you know
that?’ he said.</p>

<p>‘I heard it, I tell you.’</p>

<p>‘But there was no one in the room
except the Princess and myself.’</p>

<p>‘All the same, I heard every word
you said, and, what’s more, I shall
hear every word you ever say to
her,’ answered the Princess.</p>

<p>‘Well, then, you’ll be a great nuisance,’
said the Prince angrily.</p>

<p>‘Very well, I’ll tell the Princess all
that you say, and I’ve a good mind
not to let you succeed, as I’ve said
before.’</p>

<p>‘Then you’ll do the Princess a great
deal of harm if you do.’</p>

<p>‘Why?’</p>

<p>‘Because she’s—she’s——’ he began.</p>

<p>‘She’s what?’ asked the voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Oh, well, never mind.’</p>

<p>‘But I do mind,’ said the voice.</p>

<p>‘“She’s all that fancy painted!” if
you want to know so much,’ said the
Prince.</p>

<p>‘But I don’t see how that’ll make
any difference to her in case you
should succeed,’ said the voice.</p>

<p>‘You’re uncommonly dull if you
don’t see it,’ said the Prince, who was
beginning to feel bad-tempered over
being cross-questioned thus.</p>

<p>‘Don’t be rude, or you shan’t
succeed,’ said the voice.</p>

<p>‘If I don’t succeed the Princess
will never become Queen of the
kingdom.’</p>

<p>‘How can she become Queen of
the <i>king</i>dom?—it would have to be
a <i>queen</i>dom. And I don’t see, if
you do succeed, how she is to become
Queen!’</p>

<p>‘As I’ve said before,’ said the Prince,
‘you’re excessively dull if you don’t see.’</p>

<p>‘I shall tell her what you said.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Oh, do anything you like, only
leave me alone, do,’ said the Prince,
who by this time was quite in a
temper.</p>

<p>So she let him alone, and made no
answer when he wanted her to talk
again. However, in a few minutes
Ablot came into the square, followed
by a large number of men, whom she
heard him command to surround the
Palace, which they accordingly did;
and then, choosing five men, he and
the Prince entered the Palace, Ernalie
following them, for she didn’t know
exactly what else to do. The first of
the Palace guards they came to was
fast asleep, and they did not molest
him; but the second one was awake,
and so was the third one. These two
made some resistance, but they were
soon knocked down and bound; but
that was not much good, for they
made such a noise that they would
soon have brought the household
about their ears, only it happened to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
be Saturday and all the servants were
having a half holiday, and the only
effect of the shouting was to bring
King Mumkie out on to the landing.
He had been sitting up to let the
servants in when they came home, and
he was in rather a bad temper.</p>

<p>‘What the deuce are you making
such a noise for?’ he shouted to the
guards.</p>

<p>But as the guards had been gagged
by this time, they could only gurgle
hopelessly.</p>

<p>‘Why don’t you answer?’ roared
the King. But the guards made no
reply, and the King came running
down to see what was the matter.
He was holding a candlestick above
his head, and the light that fell on his
face showed that he was in a very
great rage indeed. When he saw the
Prince in the hall he stopped, and
said:</p>

<p>‘What do you want making this
unearthly row at this time of night?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Every one’s in bed, and I shall catch
my death of cold coming down in my
dressing-gown into this cold hall.
Now, just go off—do, and leave me
alone.’</p>

<p>‘I shall not,’ answered the Prince.</p>

<p>‘Why not? What do you want at
this time of night?’</p>

<p>‘I want the throne!’</p>

<p>‘Then you can’t have it; it’s a
reserved seat, and I’ve taken it
already.’</p>

<p>‘But what right have you to it?’</p>

<p>‘I’m the sovereign,’ said Mumkie.</p>

<p>‘You’re a false coin then—you’re
not <i>half</i> a sovereign!’</p>

<p>‘I’m quite as good as the last
sovereign. He’s lost the crown, so
he’s only worth fifteen shillings.’</p>

<p>‘Well, fifteen shillings is three
crowns, and you haven’t got one.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I have.’</p>

<p>‘Well, then, you won’t have it long.’</p>

<p>‘I shall have it to the end of my
life.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Not if I can help it,’ retorted the
Prince.</p>

<p>‘But you can’t help it.’</p>

<p>‘Why not, pray?’</p>

<p>‘Well, you can’t, unless you scalp
me,—it’s the crown of my head I
mean.’</p>

<p>‘Well, then, I’ll have your head cut
off.’</p>

<p>‘I shall die then, so I shall keep
the crown until I die. Besides, I
shall have your head cut off instead,
for I’ll call out the soldiers.’</p>

<p>‘That’s no good. They’re all on my
side,’ answered the Prince.</p>

<p>‘Then it’s all up with me. As
Julius Cæsar says—let’s see, what did
he say, now?—ah yes!’ and he
began to roar ‘A horse! a horse!
my kingdom for a horse!’</p>

<p>‘You’ll make <i>yourself</i> hoarse if you
go on roaring like that. Besides, your
share of the kingdom isn’t worth a
horse—it’s not even worth a horse-chestnut.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>‘That’s rather old,’ said the King.
‘However, what are you going to do
with me?’</p>

<p>‘I’m going to turn you into what
you wanted to turn my father into.
You shall have his cottage and all the
live-stock and implements thereto
appertaining.’</p>

<p>‘What does that mean?’ asked the
astonished Mumkie.</p>

<p>‘Oh, find out,’ said the Prince. And
he found out eventually.</p>

<p>The Prince now gave orders that
he should be taken to the coal-cellar
and locked in there for fear of escape.
And so the poor old man was led off,
muttering to himself, ‘Uneasy lies the
head that wears a crown.’</p>

<p>But the Prince answered:</p>

<p>‘Well, you needn’t talk; your head
doesn’t wear a crown.’ And from that
time forth it didn’t.</p>

<p>While this was being done, the
Princess had noticed that a man had
been stealing round the corner. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
was standing close beside her now,
and he seemed quite unconscious of
her presence. The Princess looked
at him.</p>

<p>‘He must be one of the five they
brought in with them,’ she said to herself.
So she counted; but to her
astonishment she found there were six
of them—with him.</p>

<p>‘He must be some one belonging
to the Palace,’ she thought, ‘and he
may be up to some mischief.’ So
she watched him closely. It was
evident that the rest thought he was
one of themselves, for they took no
notice of him in particular.</p>

<p>The man, however, seemed quite
innocent; but the Princess noticed
that he was fingering a pistol that he
had in his belt in a most suspicious
way. So she kept quite close to him
while they descended the stairs to the
cellars. And she was right; for, in
the twinkling of a bed-post, he drew
the pistol from his belt and aimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
straight towards the Prince. But before
he could draw the trigger, she
lifted up her hand and gave him
such a box on the ear that, in his
astonishment and pain, he dropped
the pistol altogether, and it exploded
harmlessly. As for the man, he was
so astonished that he sat down on the
floor with his mouth and eyes wide
open, looking like an expiring frog.</p>

<p>At the report of his pistol every
one turned, and Ablot noticed him
for the first time.</p>

<p>‘Why, who are you?’ he said.</p>

<p>But the man only gasped.</p>

<p>‘Who is he?’ asked the Prince of
the men.</p>

<p>‘We thought he was one of us,’
they all answered in astonishment.</p>

<p>‘Who are you?’ asked the Prince.</p>

<p>But he only gasped on in silence.</p>

<p>‘Stick a pin into him, and see if
that will bring him to.’ And a man
was just going to do it when he said,
in a gruff voice:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Don’t; I’m Wopole.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, you’re Wopole. And who’s
he?’ asked the Prince.</p>

<p>‘I used to be the falconer of the
late tyrant, now sojourning in the coal-hole
there.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! and so you tried to shoot
me?’</p>

<p>‘Not at all, your Majesty. I was
only firing a royal salute to show my
joy at your ascent to the throne.’</p>

<p>‘That’s not true,’ said the voice of
the Princess, so suddenly that every
one started and the falconer collapsed
again.</p>

<p>‘I’ve a good mind to have your
head cut off,’ said the Prince, who
by this time had grown used to the
voice. ‘However, I’ll just put you
in the coal-hole along with your late
master.’</p>

<p>Wopole having been accordingly put
into the hole, everything seemed quiet;
and as it was getting late, the Princess
thought she would leave them. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
therefore returned as fast as she could,
and getting into bed slept soundly till
morning.</p>

<p>She did not awake until long after
her usual hour, for you see she was
not used to being out so late, and
she was only roused in the morning
by the Queen knocking at the
door.</p>

<p>‘Ernalie! Ernalie!’ she called;
‘get up. It’s half-past seven. You
ought to have been up this two
hours.’</p>

<p>She got up as fast as she could;
and when she had laid the table, the
King and Queen came down.</p>

<p>‘I wish you’d knock at Treblo’s
door and tell him we’re waiting breakfast
for him,’ the Queen said to Ernalie,
and she accordingly went; but she
couldn’t get any answer, and she went
downstairs once more and told them
he seemed to be out.</p>

<p>‘Where can he be?’ asked the
King.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I rather think he’s gone out for a
walk,’ suggested the Princess.</p>

<p>‘It’s funny; he usedn’t to be fond
of getting up so early. Just go to
the door and see if he is coming
across the fields.’</p>

<p>Ernalie obediently went to the door,
and shading her eyes from the glare
of the sun, looked over the fields
towards the road.</p>

<p>She came back quickly.</p>

<p>‘I can’t see him,’ she said; ‘but
there’s a whole lot of people coming
across the field.’</p>

<p>The King looked vexedly astonished.</p>

<p>‘What on earth do they want?’ he
said. ‘It must be some fresh trick
of Mumkie for bothering me.’</p>

<p>However, by this time the people
had reached the garden gate, and they
could hear a man’s step on the gravel-walk.
It stopped at the door, and a
knock was heard.</p>

<p>‘Come in,’ cried the King; and the
man entered, bowing profoundly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>When the King saw who it was he
looked surprised, and said:</p>

<p>‘Why, Lord Corax, what do you
want with me?’</p>

<p>‘I have come to receive your
Majesty’s orders,’ said the man in a
singularly hoarse voice.</p>

<p>The King looked still more astonished.</p>

<p>‘My orders! What <i>do</i> you mean?’</p>

<p>‘I mean your Majesty’s orders for
the management of affairs,’ said the
man, with a still deeper obeisance.</p>

<p>A light broke on the King’s face.</p>

<p>‘Oh! that’s what you mean, is it?’
he said.</p>

<p>‘It is, your Majesty,’ answered the
courtier, bowing once more.</p>

<p>‘It strikes me you’re rather late in
the day coming here, aren’t you?’
asked his Majesty.</p>

<p>The courtier pulled out a large
watch.</p>

<p>‘It is, I believe, at the present
moment thirty-five and a half minutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
after eight <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, your Majesty. At
eight precisely I received orders from
your Majesty’s son to come hither,
bringing with me your Majesty’s coach
and guard of honour. Likewise a
person, by name Mumkie, who is for
the future to inhabit this cottage, and
to enjoy the privilege of using for
his own purposes all the live stock—sheep,
oxen, kine, sows, pigs, cocks,
hens——’</p>

<p>Here the King interrupted him.</p>

<p>‘That is enough. Tell them to get
the carriage ready for three, and send
Mumkie to me.’</p>

<p>‘Just so, your Majesty,’ said the
courtier, and departed on his errand.</p>

<p>When he had gone the King said
to the Queen and Ernalie:</p>

<p>‘Now, my dears, run up and put
on your best things, and, Araminta,
just see if our crowns are <i>very</i> tarnished.
We ought to make our
triumphal entry in state, for we are
reinstated. And, by the bye, see if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
you’ve got an old coronet of Treblo’s
that will fit Ernalie.’</p>

<p>‘What for, your Majesty?’ asked
Ernalie in surprise.</p>

<p>‘For you to wear, of course,’ said
the King.</p>

<p>‘But what do I want with a crown?
I have to stop here with Mumkie—I’m
part of the live stock.’</p>

<p>‘Good gracious! what do you
mean?’ said the King and Queen
together.</p>

<p>‘Well, you see, the agreement between
your son and Mumkie was that
Mumkie should have <i>all</i> the live stock
of the farm, and as I’m alive I suppose
I’m part of the live stock.’</p>

<p>‘I suppose you are,’ said the King.</p>

<p>Just at that moment a voice was
heard outside, saying:</p>

<p>‘May I come in?’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes, come in,’ said the King.</p>

<p>And Mumkie entered, looking very
dirty and black with coal-dust, for,
you see, he had spent the night in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the coal-cellar. They were all very
much surprised, and naturally too, and
the King remarked:</p>

<p>‘Good-morning! <i>Have</i> you washed?’</p>

<p>Mumkie shook his head.</p>

<p>‘I’ve been watched—only it’s not
quite the same thing, your Majesty.’</p>

<p>‘Well, never mind. So there’s been
a revolt, has there?’</p>

<p>‘A revolution, sire,’ answered Mumkie.</p>

<p>‘Ah, well, it’s all the same. They
manage these things quickly here. By
the bye, what was the arrangement
that my son made about this house?’</p>

<p>‘He said I was to have the house
and all the live stock.’</p>

<p>‘<i>All</i> the live stock?’ said the
King.</p>

<p>‘All, your Majesty.’</p>

<p>‘Then I’m afraid it’s all up with
you, Ernalie!’</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid it is, your Majesty, unless
your Majesty would buy me from
this gentleman.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Good idea! What’ll you take for
her, Mumkie?’</p>

<p>Mumkie looked at her critically.</p>

<p>‘What’s your weight?’ he said to
her suddenly.</p>

<p>‘I don’t exactly see what that has to
do with it.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I suppose you’re good, aren’t
you?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, very good,’ said the Princess.</p>

<p>‘She’s as good as gold,’ said the
Queen.</p>

<p>‘Just so,’ said Mumkie. ‘That’s
why I wanted to know her weight.
You see, I’ll sell her to you for her
weight in gold.’</p>

<p>The King put his hand in his
pocket, and drew out his purse and
looked into it.</p>

<p>‘Will you take threepence-farthing
on account?’ he said.</p>

<p>But Mumkie shook his head.</p>

<p>‘We only take ready money here, or
pay on delivery.’</p>

<p>‘Then I suppose the only thing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
do is to go to the Palace and fetch
the money. Good-bye till then,
Ernalie.’</p>

<p>So Ernalie kissed the King and
Queen, and watched them go down
the garden walk to the carriage, and
saw them get in. The guard of honour
fired a royal salute, and they drove off
at a gallop. But Ernalie turned back
into the house where Mumkie was
awaiting her.</p>

<p>‘I’ve got a friend coming here to-day,
shortly, and I don’t want to have
our conversation overheard, so when
he comes you cut your stick. Go and
perform some wholesome menial function—clean
the plates. Understand?
And don’t you listen at the door,
miss.’</p>

<p>‘I am not in the habit of listening
at doors, and you’d better call
me “your Royal Highness,” if you
please.’</p>

<p>‘And why, your Royal Highness?’</p>

<p>‘Because I’m a Princess.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Oh, you are! Then, I suppose,
you’re a foreigner? And they have
a custom here with foreigners of
boiling them alive. How would you
like that, your Royal Highness?’</p>

<p>‘You daren’t do it,’ said the
Princess; but all the same she felt
rather frightened. Just then a knock
came at the door.</p>

<p>‘That’s Wopole,’ said Mumkie, ‘so
your Royal Highness may take yourself
off, and if I catch you listening at the
door I’ll skin you alive.’</p>

<p>‘I never listen at doors,’ said the
Princess. But she thought to herself:
‘I listen inside the room sometimes,
though.’ And she ran upstairs to fetch
her feather. She got it very quickly,
and ran downstairs as lightly as possible.
They had shut the door of the
room, but she opened it boldly, and
stepped in as quietly as she could.
Mumkie looked up, as if he expected
to see some one come in; but of course
he did not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>‘It’s the wind, I suppose,’ said
Wopole. ‘Anyhow, you’d better shut
it. Some one might be listening.’</p>

<p>So Mumkie got up and shut it, and
then went back to his seat again.</p>

<p>‘You say you can’t try to murder
this Prince again?’ he said.</p>

<p>Wopole shook his head.</p>

<p>‘It’s no good. I tried last night,
and I got such a box on my ear that
I was half killed.’</p>

<p>‘But who gave it to you?’</p>

<p>‘How on earth should I know? I
could see nobody. Just as I was raising
the pistol to shoot—bang! it came.
I wouldn’t try it again for anything.’</p>

<p>‘What a nuisance it is that you let
that feather fall out of the eagle’s tail.
You could have done it easily then.
As it is, I don’t know what to do.
You won’t try again, and I’m too old,
and no one else in the country would
hurt him for love or money. There’s
only one other thing to do, and it’s not
an easy task, anyway.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Oh, never mind the ease or difficulty.
If it’s possible to be done, I’ll
do it.’</p>

<p>‘Then I’ll tell you. You’ll have to
cut his thread of life.’</p>

<p>‘Really, and what with?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, anything you like. The trouble
is to get to the place where they’re
kept.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! and where is that?’</p>

<p>‘They’re kept by three old women
who live in the moon. They’re called
the Fates.’</p>

<p>‘And how am I to get to the
moon?’</p>

<p>‘That’s just it. You’ll have to take
a boat one evening at six, and if you
sail straight towards the moon while
she is visible, and anchor when she is
out of sight, in three weeks and two
days you will reach the end of the sea,
where the moon touches at night, and
then you can get out of the boat; and
take care to haul it up out of reach
of the sea, or else it’ll be carried off,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
and you won’t be able to get back to
the earth again.’</p>

<p>‘And when I’ve got to the moon
what am I to do?’</p>

<p>‘The moon’s not a very large place,
although it’s certainly larger than it
looks from the earth. There are five
people who live in the moon. One is
the man in the moon, the rest are all
women; these are three Fates, who
sit twisting the threads of life into one
large rope, and besides that there’s
Diana; but she keeps to herself, and
never troubles about the other four.
When you touch the shore you’ll see
the man in the moon. He’s a wrinkled
old man, who carries a bundle of sticks
and a lanthorn. When you meet him,
give him a loaf of bread to pacify
him, for the moon being made of
green cheese they have nothing else
to eat, and so they’re very fond of
bread to eat with it. Ask him the
way to the Miss Parkers—those are
the three Fates. He’ll show you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
in reward for the bread, and then
you’ll see the house. Knock at the
door, and when it’s opened, slip in.
The Fates are blind, and won’t see
you. When you get in you’ll see a
lot of reels of silver threads. Among
them you’ll see his thread. You’ll
know it by the label on the reel.
Cut that and those of the King and
Queen, and then come back again as
soon as you like.’</p>

<p>‘Very well, then; when shall I start?’
asked Wopole.</p>

<p>‘When you will.’</p>

<p>‘Will to-morrow evening do?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, quite well.’</p>

<p>‘Very well, I’ll start to-morrow
evening about eight. In the meantime,
I must see about getting food,
as I’m not a fasting man.’</p>

<p>‘Very well, do.’</p>

<p>Just then came a knock at the door,
and Wopole said:</p>

<p>‘Well, I suppose it’s settled. I shall
open the door and see who’s knocking.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Yes, do. I suppose it’s some one
come to buy this Princess.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, is it?’ and Wopole went to
open the door.</p>

<p>The Princess meanwhile quietly
slipped upstairs and took the feather
out. In a few moments she heard a
voice calling her, and she went down.
She found the Prince with the other
two in the little parlour.</p>

<p>‘Good-morning, Ernalie,’ he said;
and she answered, ‘Good-morning.’</p>

<p>‘This absurd man,’ the Prince went
on, ‘insists that you shall be weighed,
although I offered him two thousand
ounces of gold; and I’m sure you
don’t weigh that. However, he will
have you weighed, and it can’t be
helped.’</p>

<p>‘I suppose it can’t,’ said the Princess.</p>

<p>So she was weighed. It doesn’t
matter what she did weigh, but it
was less than two thousand ounces.
The Prince ordered the two men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
whom he had brought with him as
bearers of the gold, to stop and see
it properly weighed out, and then he
set out with the Princess for the
town.</p>

<p>‘I thought you wouldn’t mind there
not being an escort,’ he said apologetically;
‘but all the people about
the Palace are busy preparing for a
festival.’</p>

<p>The Princess said she didn’t mind
at all.</p>

<p>She had not had much time to
think about what she had heard Wopole
and Mumkie say, nevertheless
she determined to tell the Prince all
she had heard.</p>

<p>When he had listened to it all, he
laughed.</p>

<p>‘Ah, well, if that’s all I’ve got to
fear I’m quite safe. He’s sure to
get drowned if he tries,’ was all he
said; and he refused to say anything
more on the subject.</p>

<p>So they went quietly on till they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
came to a slight hill down which the
road went, and from the top they
could see the city shining in the
morning sun.</p>

<p>‘It’s a very beautiful place, isn’t it?’
said the Prince.</p>

<p>‘Very beautiful; only my own
country is far more beautiful.’</p>

<p>‘It must be very beautiful indeed,
then. However, I suppose this is
good enough for you while you are
away from your own country.’</p>

<p>‘It’ll have to be, at any rate,’ said
the Princess dismally, as they went
down the hill.</p>

<p>They soon reached the city, and
went, through crowds of bowing citizens
and citizenesses, to the Palace,
where they found the King and Queen
anxiously awaiting them.</p>

<p>‘So you’ve come at last,’ the King
said; ‘I was afraid that you would
come to some harm with that Mumkie.’</p>

<p>But the Princess laughed.</p>

<p>‘Oh no,’ she said; ‘I’m quite able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
to take care of myself and of other
people too; and while I was in the
house I heard something of great importance.’
And she proceeded to tell
them what she had heard.</p>

<p>But when she had finished, the
King laughed even more than his son
had done.</p>

<p>‘Why, my dear little girl,’ he said,
‘do you believe all that rigmarole?
They were having a joke at your expense.
They must have heard you
outside the door and wanted to frighten
you. Don’t you think of such rubbish.
Why, if they tried it on alone they’d
get swallowed up in a storm; and I’m
sure none of my people would ever
help them.’</p>

<p>But the Princess did not feel at all
convinced, all the same.</p>

<p>‘You might just as well have them
put in prison, and then they couldn’t
do anything.’</p>

<p>But the King shook his head.</p>

<p>‘That’s just it, you see; I’ve only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
just let them go, and I can’t put them
into prison unless they’ve committed
some fresh crime.’</p>

<p>‘But isn’t it treason to compass the
death of the King or his eldest son?’</p>

<p>‘It is; but then it’s such a foolish
scheme that no one would believe any
one capable of inventing it. So we’d
better leave it alone.’</p>

<p>But still the Princess was not at all
convinced.</p>

<p>‘If you won’t stop him going, I shall
go with him,’ she said.</p>

<p>‘But he won’t take you,’ said the
King.</p>

<p>‘He won’t be able to help it,’ said
she.</p>

<p>‘Oh, well, have your own way, my
dear,’ said the King good-naturedly;
for he thought she would change her
mind. But she was quite in earnest.</p>

<p>However, she didn’t say anything
more about it, and the rest of the
day went on quietly.</p>

<p>The old King and his son attended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the council just as if nothing unusual
had ever intervened between it and
the last council they had held before
they had been turned out. As for the
Queen and Princess, they occupied
themselves with choosing dresses for
a grand ball that was to be given on
the day after the morrow. So that
the time was pretty well filled up
until the evening; and as the Princess
said she felt rather tired, she went
out to take a walk on the sands by
the sea. To tell the truth, she intended
to see whether Wopole were
not making preparations.</p>

<p>Now it so happened that the Prince,
too, was going out to take an evening
stroll, and so they went together; and
as the town was rather full, they
walked along the beach to get out
of the way of the enthusiastic populace,
who insisted on congratulating
him on his good fortune. This is
a habit of populaces, they are all fond
of congratulating any one who is successful—but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
they never assist any one
to success if they can help it. So
they walked on for some time, and
as the evening was approaching, turned
back towards the harbour.</p>

<p>Now it happened that as they came
round a bend of the shore they
noticed a crowd assembled round one
of the boats.</p>

<p>‘I wonder what the excitement is?’
said the Princess.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know, really, unless it’s
some gigantic dog-fish, or perhaps
they’ve found a scale of the sea-serpent.
Shall we go and look at
it?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, let us,’ said the Princess
eagerly.</p>

<p>And so they went towards the
crowd, who made way at their approach.</p>

<p>‘Why, it’s Wopole!’ said the Princess
suddenly; and so it was.</p>

<p>‘What is he up to?’ asked the
Prince of one of the bystanders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I don’t know, your Majesty, only
we saw him coming along bringing
packages of things to his boat here,
and we thought we’d come and see
that he wasn’t up to mischief.’</p>

<p>The Prince then spoke to Wopole,
who was looking angrily at him.</p>

<p>‘Well, Wopole,’ he said, ‘what are
you up to now?’</p>

<p>‘I’m going to leave the country,’
said he angrily.</p>

<p>‘A good thing for the country,’ said
several of the crowd. But the Prince
said:</p>

<p>‘I’m sorry you’re going to leave
us. However, I shall be glad to
make you a small present before you
go.’ And he felt in his coat, and
after a moment’s search he drew out a
minute pair of nail-scissors. ‘Perhaps
these might be of some use to you.
They’re very good for cutting threads
of any kind. Good-day.’</p>

<p>And pretending not to notice his
look of astonishment, he drew the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Princess’s arm through his, and they
walked off.</p>

<p>‘Why did you do that?’ asked the
Princess, after they had got out of
hearing.</p>

<p>The Prince laughed.</p>

<p>‘I thought it might surprise him a
little,’ he said. ‘And they wouldn’t
cut butter if they were heated, so he
won’t do much harm with them.’</p>

<p>‘So you don’t mean to stop him?’</p>

<p>The Prince laughed.</p>

<p>‘No, no!’ he said; ‘why should I?
He’ll never get to the moon.’</p>

<p>‘Then if you don’t stop him I shall
go with him.’</p>

<p>‘I think he’ll take care that you
don’t,’ retorted the Prince.</p>

<p>‘But he won’t be able to help himself.’</p>

<p>‘And why not?’</p>

<p>Because he won’t be able to see
me.’</p>

<p>‘Nonsense!’</p>

<p>‘You may call it nonsense if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
like. But do you remember some one
who spoke to you last night in the
square? You couldn’t see me then,
and why should he stop me if he can’t
see me?’</p>

<p>‘Good gracious! Was that you
last night? How stupid of me not
to recognise your voice! But you
won’t go with him, will you?’</p>

<p>‘I shall, unless you stop him.’</p>

<p>‘But I promised not to stop him,
and I can’t break my promise.’</p>

<p>‘Then I must go, that’s all. I can’t
allow you and your father and mother
to be killed because you’ve promised
not to stop him.’</p>

<p>‘But, Ernalie, can’t I go instead?’</p>

<p>‘He wouldn’t take you, and you
can’t make yourself invisible, you
see.’</p>

<p>‘But all the same, you must not
go; it’s absurd.’</p>

<p>‘Why?’</p>

<p>‘You may be drowned, or anything.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>‘If I’m drowned or anything Wopole
will have to be drowned or anythinged
too, so that you’ll be safe in
any case.’</p>

<p>‘But I don’t want to be safe if
you are drowned.’</p>

<p>‘What difference will it make to
you if I’m drowned or not?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Ernalie, you are too bad,’ he
said earnestly. ‘Can’t you see I love
you more than all the world?’</p>

<p>The Princess looked at him in utter
astonishment.</p>

<p>‘You love me!’ she said, with her
lips parted and the colour coming and
going in her cheeks. ‘Why, whatever
made you?’</p>

<p>And the Prince answered naturally:</p>

<p>‘Why, you did, of course.’</p>

<p>‘But you’ve not known me for more
than two days.’</p>

<p>‘If I had known you only for two
hours it would have been more than
enough. You are the most beautiful
girl I ever saw.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Perhaps you’ve not seen many,’
said the Princess.</p>

<p>He took no notice of her flippant
remark—he was very much in earnest.</p>

<p>‘I love you as much as the whole
world, and a great deal besides. And
don’t you love me a little in return?’</p>

<p>‘Well, to tell the truth, I never
thought of it at all before; but now
I come to think of it I do love you,
and a very great deal too—if you don’t
tease.’</p>

<p>So they prolonged the stroll indefinitely,
thinking nothing about the
unpleasant walking that the heavy
shingle afforded, or even that it was
getting very dark, and that the air was
chilly with the night and the sea-foam
that the wind blew against them, so
that it was after supper-time by a great
deal when they arrived at the Palace
once more. But all that he could say
would not persuade her not to go with
Wopole, although she was very sorry
that she could not stop. But, as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
said, it was no use stopping if her
love died, and if any one was to die
she would be the one. Wopole was
sure to die with her, so the Prince
would be safe at any rate. And
although the King and Queen both
tried to dissuade her it made no
difference. She refused to promise
not to go.</p>

<p>So on the next day they watched
her carefully, though without hindering
her going about.</p>

<p>The day went past just as the day
before had done, and about the same
time in the evening she asked the
Prince to go down to the beach with
her, and they went just as before.
But all the while the Prince kept fast
hold of her hand.</p>

<p>So they walked along the beach as
the wind freshened, and they talked of
all sorts of things,—it is not necessary
to say what.</p>

<p>But the Princess noticed that the
boat which Wopole had loaded with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
provisions was almost in the water,
and Wopole and Mumkie were both
standing talking by it.</p>

<p>So she drew the feather quietly out
of her pocket, for you may be sure she
had not forgotten to bring it. Suddenly
she said:</p>

<p>‘Oh dear! my shoe’s full of sand.
I must take it off and shake it out.’</p>

<p>‘Will you let me do it for you?’
said the Prince, who stepped easily
into the trap.</p>

<p>‘Yes, you might, if it’s not too much
trouble,’ she said.</p>

<p>So he knelt down, and unlaced her
shoe, took it off, and shook out the
sand, and then put it on again for her.
He was just getting up again when the
Princess gave him a little push, so that
he lost his balance altogether, and
before he could recover himself she
put the feather to her hair, and ran
along the sands to the boat which
Wopole and Mumkie were just about
to launch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>She stepped over the back just
before they reached it, and then she
went at once to the front of the
boat in order not to be in the way
of Wopole when he got on board.
In a moment the boat was dancing on
the water, and Wopole sprang in over
the stern. The boat shipped a good
deal over the bows, and the Princess
got rather wet. However, she was too
excited to care much about a little
water.</p>

<p>In a few moments Wopole had
hauled up the sail, and the boat began
to move through the dancing waters.
Just at this moment Treblo reached
the edge of the sea, and saw the boat
well out of his power.</p>

<p>‘Come back!’ he cried to Wopole.</p>

<p>‘Don’t you!’ said Mumkie.</p>

<p>‘You needn’t be afraid!’ Wopole
called as loud as he could. ‘I shan’t
come back!’</p>

<p>‘But you’ve got the Princess on
board!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>‘You bet!’ remarked Wopole with
familiar vulgarity now he was out of
the Prince’s reach.</p>

<p>The Princess thought it was her
turn to say something, so she called:</p>

<p>‘Good-bye, Treblo, my love, good-bye!’</p>

<p>Wopole was naturally somewhat surprised
at this voice that appeared to
come from nowhere in particular.</p>

<p>‘I suppose she’s hanging in the
water,’ he said to himself out loud.
‘I shan’t trouble to help her on board
if she is. I shall just let her drown.’</p>

<p>‘How very good of you,’ remarked
Ernalie sweetly.</p>

<p>Wopole looked surprised.</p>

<p>‘Sounds as if she was on board.
However, she isn’t.’</p>

<p>And as the Princess thought it best
to be quiet, he remained of the same
opinion.</p>

<p>All the while the boat had been
getting rapidly out of the bay, and
the Princess thought they were quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
safe from pursuit. But suddenly Wopole
rose from his seat in the stern
and let down the sail.</p>

<p>‘What on earth is he going to
do?’ thought the Princess. ‘He can’t
be going to stop.’</p>

<p>However, it was soon pretty clear
what he was going to do, for she
noticed he was steering towards a
large vessel that lay near them.</p>

<p>The way that the sail had left on
the boat was sufficient to carry them
to the vessel, which the boat soon
bumped against. Wopole now seemed
to be coming forward; and as there
was not room in the boat for her
to slip past him, she jumped from
the bow and managed to scramble
on board the ship, although it was
rather difficult, and boats have a
habit of slipping away under any one
who tries jumping off them.</p>

<p>However, she luckily managed it,
and was soon safe on board.</p>

<p>She was followed almost immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
by Wopole, who didn’t find much
difficulty in getting on board; in fact,
he came so quickly that he almost
fell on top of the Princess. However,
she just managed to slip out of his
way, and he did not notice her, as
he was occupied in tying the boat-rope
to a cleat.</p>

<p>He then went through various nautical
exercises—such as boxing the
compass, and shivering his timbers,
and danging his lee-deadlights, and
other things which it takes a sailor,
or a nautical novel-writer, to understand.
The effect of these operations
was to make the sails run up, and
then the vessel bent to the freshening
gale and began to walk the waters
like a thing of life—at least, as like
a thing of life as a wet sheet and a
flowing sea and a wind to follow after,
but no legs, could make it walk.</p>

<p>Wopole had taken the helm by this
time, and he was steering a course
east by west, so that they stood—that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
is, they walked—straight out from
the shore. Thus they sailed on for an
hour or two till the moon began to show
itself, and then Wopole altered the course
so that they sailed straight towards her.
It might be as well to explain that in
those days a ship was only provided with
two sails, and so one man could manage
a pretty large ship; and as Wopole was
a very strong man, it stands to reason
that he could manage a rather large
ship. So, you see, it was not altogether
so impossible as it looks to sail for three
weeks alone on the sea, although I own it
would be somewhat difficult nowadays.</p>

<p>When the moon rose, as I have mentioned
before, Wopole steered straight
for it, and he continued steering straight
towards it all night—at least all the time
that the moon could be seen.</p>

<p>Towards sunrise, however, the moon
set; and as soon as he could see
it no more, he let down the sail,
threw his anchor overboard, and in a
few moments the ship was at rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>When this had been done he walked
to a hatch, which he opened, and
took out some beef, captain’s biscuits,
and pickled pork. From these he
cut slices and placed the slices on
plates, after which he took the joints
back to the hatchway and put them
in the meat-safes again. Then he
filled a glass with water from a little
cistern that stood on deck.</p>

<p>After these preparations, he sat down
and made a comfortable meal, and
then he went downstairs—that is,
down the hatchway—and into his
cabin.</p>

<p>He seemed to have departed for
good, so the Princess followed his
example—at least, so far as the eating
was concerned; only, she washed
the knives, forks, and plates before she
used them.</p>

<p>‘I wonder if he’ll see any difference
in the size of the joints?’ she thought
to herself. ‘If he does, he won’t
know how it is, so that’s all right.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>So she made a hearty meal, and
then replaced the things just as he
had put them.</p>

<p>The question now was—how to pass
away the time?—and it was a very
difficult one to answer. There were
no books to read—at least, she was
not able to find any on deck. So
she tried playing cat’s-cradle by herself;
but that was not a very great
success, because there was no one to
take it up. She next attempted going
to sleep, but that was not a success
either. Then she tried counting how
many times the ship rolled in the
course of an hour; but she always
forgot how many hundreds she had
counted. At last she went and sat
on one of the bulwarks and watched
the porpoises as they played about
the ship’s bows. So the day passed
away and evening came, and just as
the sun set Wopole came on deck
yawning and stretching himself.</p>

<p>He looked at the vane, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
blown out nearly straight in the evening
wind.</p>

<p>‘A nice breeze,’ the Princess heard
him say to himself. ‘If the wind
holds good like this it won’t take more
than a fortnight.’</p>

<p>‘Thank goodness,’ the Princess said
to herself; for she was beginning
already to grow rather tired of the
adventure. ‘I think I’ll go down
and see what the vessel is like below-stairs.’</p>

<p>So she descended the dark hatchway
as well as she could, though it
was no easy matter, for the boat was
beginning to roll in a most unpleasant
manner; for, you see, the wind was
freshening a good deal, and Wopole
had not yet hoisted the sails. However,
she managed to get to the bottom
without tumbling down more than four
steps at a time.</p>

<p>It was not quite dark in the cabin
below, for an open port-hole let in
the last rays of daylight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>The cabin was a very small one,
though it did not seem very cosy;
however, the Princess was delighted
to see one thing, and that was that
there were some books on a table in
the centre of the cabin.</p>

<p>She went and looked at their titles,
but it was too dark to read them,
and she didn’t know where to find
the matches. Through the porthole
she could see that the sea was getting
rougher, and the waves were beginning
to dash loudly against the side of the
boat.</p>

<p>‘It’ll be getting wet on deck,’ she
thought to herself; ‘I think I shall stop
where I am, for I hate being damp,
and I’m quite comfortable here.’ Just
at this moment she heard heavy steps
coming down the hatchway. ‘Good
gracious! here’s Wopole coming down.
What does he want, I wonder?’</p>

<p>Wopole opened the door and
looked in, but he didn’t seem to
notice her. He just put his arm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
round the door and unhooked a
tarpaulin coat that was hanging there.
Then he took a sou’-wester from
another peg and put it on his head
and shut the door again, and she
heard him tramp up on to the deck.</p>

<p>‘I suppose he’s gone for good,’ she
said to herself. ‘Anyhow, I’ll lock
the door, and then he won’t be able
to get in.’ So she locked the door
with the key that was in the lock.
‘Now I wonder where the bed is?’
she thought. ‘That place like a shelf
can’t be it; but it’s got bed-clothes
on it. However, I can’t get into it.
I shall just lie on this sofa for the
night.’</p>

<p>So she lay down and slept all night
in spite of the noise that the wind
and waves made.</p>

<p>She awoke next morning on hearing
a most tremendous rumble and
splashing.</p>

<p>‘What is that?’ she said to herself.
‘He must be letting out the anchor.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>And so he was; for in a moment
she heard him coming downstairs.</p>

<p>‘I wonder what he’ll do when he
finds the door locked?’ she thought.</p>

<p>Just then he reached the door and
turned the handle, but the door refused
to move; and although he kicked
and banged, it was all no use.</p>

<p>‘I’ll go and fetch a hatchet and
prise it open,’ he grunted, out of
breath with his exertions; and he
thumped up the stairs again.</p>

<p>But meanwhile the Princess unlocked
the door, and seizing a couple
of books at random off the bookshelf
she ran up on deck; but she
kept possession of the door-key.</p>

<p>Now it so happened that Wopole
had dropped his hatchet in front of
the hatchway, and he was bending
down to pick it up just as she came
out of it, so that the result was a
collision; and as Wopole was bending
down he got considerably the worst
of it, although the books that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Princess was carrying were thrown
right out of her hands.</p>

<p>Wopole got up from the sitting
posture which the sudden shock had
made him assume.</p>

<p>‘Well, this is extraordinary! Shiver
my old lee-scuppers if it isn’t! Here
first I can’t get into my cabin, and
then I’m knocked over by my own
books that come flying at my head.
I think it’s those books that are the
cause of the mischief, and I’ll just
throw them overboard,’ and he was
just bending over to pick them up.
But this was too much for the Princess,
who had no wish to be left for
the whole of another day without
books. So she snatched the books
from just under his hand—at least,
the book he was going to pick up—and
as soon as she touched it, it
became invisible.</p>

<p>Wopole shook his head dismally as
if he had quite expected it, and then
he tried to pick up the other one;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
but just the same thing happened.
Now the Princess had just been bending
down to pick the book up as
he bent down, and the wind blew
her hair right across his eyes. He,
feeling the tickling, put his hand up
to his face and caught the hair before
she could draw it away.</p>

<p>‘What is this now?’ he said, as
he examined his hand. ‘Feels like
hair,’ he mused. But in his fit of
musing he let his fingers relax their
grasp, and she drew her hair away
very quickly.</p>

<p>‘I thought so,’ Wopole said. ‘It
was only the hair—the wind, I mean.
I wonder what’s the matter with the
books, though? It must be the cabin
that’s bewitched them. I won’t sleep
in that cabin to-day. I’ll change my
apartments at once.’</p>

<p>And he did. So, for the rest of
the time, the Princess had the cabin
all to herself, and she was quite contented;
for Wopole was so sure that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
it was bewitched, that he moved his
clothes and things out of it, and never
came near it again.</p>

<p>And the Princess had decidedly
the best of it; for Wopole slept all
day and watched all night, and she
kept awake all day and slept all night
just as usual. So the time passed
away, and every night the moon got
larger and larger as they got nearer
and nearer, until it was quite close.</p>

<p>They had been a fortnight and three
days out before they came to the edge
of the sea, but it was eight o’clock
in the evening, and the moon had
just left the water, as it flew into
the air like a large—a very large—white
bird.</p>

<p>‘What a confounded nuisance!’
Ernalie heard Wopole say. ‘Now I
shall have to wait the whole of another
day for it to rise above the sea; and
then it’s so jolly dangerous.’</p>

<p>The Princess couldn’t help wondering
why it was so jolly dangerous;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
and how, if it were dangerous, it
could be jolly. So she asked—quite
without thinking that she was invisible:</p>

<p>‘Why?’</p>

<p>‘Why, you dunderhead!’ retorted
Wopole; ‘because we’re quite near
the edge of the world, and if a strong
wind should rise we should be blown
right over it, and then we should fall
right into the sun. See, stupid?’</p>

<p>The Princess replied meekly:</p>

<p>‘I thank you.’</p>

<p>‘I should think you ought to thank
me,’ Wopole retorted angrily. ‘It’s
bad enough to have spirits on board
a temperance ship without having to
talk to them.’</p>

<p>‘But I’m not a spirit,’ said Ernalie.</p>

<p>‘Then who are you?’</p>

<p>‘I’m——’ But she thought it best
not to tell him more.</p>

<p>‘Oh, you are, are you?’ he replied.
‘Thanks for the information. I’m
sure it wasn’t necessary for you to
tell me so much, and I don’t want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
to know any more about you. Only,
look here, I don’t know whether you
want to be roasted?’</p>

<p>‘Of course not,’ answered the Princess.</p>

<p>‘Well, then, if a storm comes
up it will blow us right over the
world’s end into the sun; so look
out. If the anchor holds, we are
safe.’</p>

<p>‘What does the anchor hold?’ asked
Ernalie.</p>

<p>‘The ground, of course. If it
doesn’t, we shall have to hoist the
sails and try to beat against the
wind.’</p>

<p>‘I suppose you beat against the
wind to make it run away?’ said
Ernalie.</p>

<p>But Wopole replied gruffly:</p>

<p>‘No puns allowed on board. Now,
if we have to beat against the wind,
I shall have to manage the sails, so
you must go to the helm.’</p>

<p>‘What is the helm?’ she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>‘That’s it,’ said Wopole, pointing
to it.</p>

<p>‘Oh, that’s the helm; and what am
I to do with it?’</p>

<p>‘Do what I tell you.’</p>

<p>‘Very well.’</p>

<p>‘That’s all.’</p>

<p>So the Princess, not seeing anything
better to do, went down below
to bed.</p>

<p>The night passed safely, and nearly
the whole of the next day; but towards
evening the wind began to get up.
Wopole was on deck, and as he did
not seem to wish to talk she let him
alone. About seven the moon was
to rise, and at about half-past five
Ernalie went down to her cabin to
get a book. She selected a small one
that she had not noticed before. It
was called ‘The Life and Surprising
Adventures of Robinson Crusoe of Hull,
Mariner, who——’ But before she had
half finished the title-page—which, by
the bye, is rather long—a sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
reeling of the vessel threw her right
over to one corner of the room, and
at the same time from above there
sounded a shrieking as of ten thousand
demons.</p>

<p>‘What on earth is that?’ she thought
as well as she could, for she was lying
in one corner of the room among
chairs and various other articles of
furniture. However, she got out of it
as quickly as she could, and ran on
deck, or at least she tried to run, for
the vessel was rolling and pitching,
and the shrieking continued to resound
from above. At last she did reach the
deck; but she rather wished she had
stopped below, for the wind was so
biting it nearly bit her hair off, and
this same wind behaved so badly to
the ropes of the vessel that they
shrieked in their pain as the blast cut
past them, causing the strange sounds
that the Princess had heard below.</p>

<p>It was nearly as difficult to stand on
deck as it had been in the cabin, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the spray that came dashing over the
boat made it very difficult to see, for
it got into her eyes and half blinded her.</p>

<p>However, she managed to steady
herself by holding on to a rope, and
in a few minutes she was able to see
Wopole standing in the bow of the
boat, and looking over the side. So
she went towards him as well as she
could, for the wind and spray came
from over the bows. Nevertheless,
she reached him somehow. He
was leaning quietly against the bulwarks
over the hawser-hole watching
the straining cable, just as calm as
if there were nothing in particular depending
on whether the anchor held
or not.</p>

<p>As soon as she could find her breath
she touched him on the shoulder and
shouted in his ear as loud as she
could:</p>

<p>‘Will the rope break?’ But it was
no use trying to out-roar the tempest—at
least for her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>When Wopole felt something touch
him on the shoulder he looked round.</p>

<p>‘Oh, it’s you, is it?’ she heard him cry.
But the wind was still too high for her
to answer. She only nodded; but
she might have spared herself the
trouble.</p>

<p>Presently, after she had waited some
minutes in silence, the wind fell, almost
as suddenly as it had risen.</p>

<p>‘Thank goodness! It’s over now,’
she said, and it was so quiet that
Wopole overheard her easily.</p>

<p>‘Don’t hulloa till you’re out of the
wood,’ he said. ‘Look there!’</p>

<p>The Princess did look, and she saw
that the horizon was hidden by masses
of white foam that rose and fell as if
the sea were one great cauldron full of
boiling water.</p>

<p>‘That’s the storm coming down again,’
Wopole went on. ‘Hurry to the helm
and put it hard down when I hoist the
sail, for the cable will snap like thread
before it. Quick—quick!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>The Princess ran like lightning along
the deck, for the sea was quite quiet,
and the vessel hardly pitched at all,
and she reached the helm in a very few
minutes.</p>

<p>When she got there she stood still
and listened. Everything was quiet
and still; the vessel only rolled slightly,
and the cordage creaked uneasily, as if
it feared the coming strain that it would
have to stand. From where the sea
boiled a noise came—so low and
grumbling that it might have been the
faint growl of an angry cat before it
makes a spring.</p>

<p>Just then Wopole looked towards
the helm:</p>

<p>‘Mind and put it hard down!’ he
shouted.</p>

<p>‘I wonder why he wants me to put
it down,’ she thought.</p>

<p>But before she could ask the storm
was upon them again. Swifter than
the arrow leaps from the bow it came,
and the churned sea fled from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
attack of the wind like a mighty white
horse. The flying scud and rain beat
mercilessly against her face; but she
held bravely to the tiller, and stemmed
the storm as well as she could, with
her eyes shut and her teeth set.</p>

<p>The noise the storm made would
have frightened Neptune himself; but
high over it she heard Wopole shout:</p>

<p>‘The cable’s parted! Hard down!’</p>

<p>And she pressed on the tiller as hard
as she could; but the stubborn bar
refused to go down, and though she
leant her whole weight on it, it only
fell away to one side, and she had only
strength to lie against it in vain hope
of putting it down. Just then the sail
began to raise itself, and the vessel
seemed to feel its influence, for it was
turning slowly round. Suddenly she
saw Wopole appear in the mist of rain.</p>

<p>‘Let me have the tiller!’ he shouted;
and she let go. Instantly he seized it
and pushed it the other way with all
his might.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>But at this critical moment a
disaster happened, that made it look
as if everything had conspired against
them. The tiller broke in half under
the strong hands of Wopole, and before
they could wink the vessel had turned
its back to the wind, and they were
carried at racing speed towards the
end of the world. They had but a
mile or so to go, and a mile is soon
covered.</p>

<p>The last part of the journey was
through a thick mist; but it didn’t
much matter to Ernalie.</p>

<p>‘Anyhow, Wopole won’t be able to
cut the strings,’ she thought.</p>

<p>Just then the fog began to get
lighter, as if some great fire were just
outside it, and in a few seconds they
burst through the veil of mist into a
light so blinding that the Princess could
not keep her eyes open.</p>

<p>‘This must be the sun we’ve fallen
into,’ she thought. ‘But it doesn’t
seem very hot.’ Then there was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
bump, as if the boat had run into a
lump of mud, and then a greasy slide,
and then Ernalie fainted.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When she came to herself, she heard
voices close to her. One sounded like
the voice of an old man, and the other,
she was quite sure, was that of Wopole;
but she had never heard him so polite
before. They had evidently only just
met, for Wopole was saying:</p>

<p>‘I am very happy to make your
acquaintance, sir. May I trouble you
to tell me your name?’</p>

<p>‘It’s a great deal of trouble,’
grumbled the other; ‘but I’ll tell
you. I’m the Man.’</p>

<p>‘How strange—I too happen to be
a man.’</p>

<p>‘You’re only <i>a</i> man. I’m <i>the</i> Man.’</p>

<p>‘The Man in the Moon, I should
think?’ said Wopole.</p>

<p>‘Exactly,’ answered the voice.</p>

<p>‘Why, we must be in the moon,’
thought the Princess; and it was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
case, for the ship had run right over
the edge of the world on to the moon,
which had been hidden behind the
clouds.</p>

<p>‘I’ll just go and look at him,’ she
said to herself, and so she sat up to
look where the voices came from.
‘They seem to be behind the sail,’
she went on. So she walked to the
sail, and peeped round the corner, and
there sure enough he was.</p>

<p>I daresay you’ve often seen the Man
in the Moon—at all events, you ought to
have. Perhaps you mayn’t have; if
so, this is what the Princess saw.</p>

<p>He was a very old man, and looked
very much as if he was in his second
childhood, and he carried an enormous
lanthorn, which made him even more
bent than he might have been if he
had not carried it so often. On his
shoulders he carried a bundle of thorns,
which appeared to prick him and cause
him a good deal of uneasiness generally;
and besides this he had an ugly little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
dog by his side, which made continual
attacks on Wopole’s shins, and it made
such a noise with its barking that the
old man in a temper aimed a vicious
kick at it; but he missed his mark, and
the weight of the lanthorn overbalancing
him he sat down rather suddenly, and
during the rest of the evening he remained
there.</p>

<p>But the conversation proceeded just
as if nothing in particular had happened.</p>

<p>‘Being the Man in the Moon, perhaps
you would be so kind as to
direct me to the place where the
Misses Parker reside?’ Wopole said.</p>

<p>‘That I won’t,’ said the Man. ‘Why
should I?’</p>

<p>‘I thought that you might be so good
as to direct me, and I had intended
presenting you with a loaf of bread.
However, that does not matter. Good-day.
I daresay I shall find the house
by myself,’ and Wopole made preparations
for getting over the side of the
vessel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>But the Man no sooner heard the
word ‘bread’ than he became very
eager to help him on the way.</p>

<p>‘Oh, wait a minute,’ he said; and
Wopole accordingly waited.</p>

<p>‘If you’ll give me two loaves I’ll
show you,’ he went on.</p>

<p>‘I’ll give you one now, and the
other when I have paid my visit and
am safely back on the ship.’</p>

<p>‘Well, that’ll do. Give me the one,
and I’ll show you at once.’</p>

<p>So Wopole went to the hatch which
covered the pantry and took out a
large loaf, which he handed to the old
Man.</p>

<p>‘Now trot,’ he said; and the Man
hurried to the side of the vessel and
scrambled down as well as he could,
followed by Wopole and the Princess.</p>

<p>It was curious how bright it was
when they got over the side; for
although it was past nine o’clock <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>
by the Princess’s watch, the ground
itself seemed to shoot out light, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
what was still more funny, they threw
no shadows, although that was easily
explained; for as the moon itself
provided the light, it would be rather
difficult to throw a shadow on the
moon.</p>

<p>They plodded on for some time in
silence; but although the old Man
hobbled very much he managed to
get along very fast, almost too fast
for the Princess, for the walking was
very heavy.</p>

<p>Presently Wopole said:</p>

<p>‘How soft the ground is; is it all
the same about here?’</p>

<p>‘Of course it is. It’s all cheese;
and you don’t want hard cheese.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t want cheese at all,’ said
Wopole.</p>

<p>‘You’d want it if you were me,’
remarked the old Man.</p>

<p>‘Why?’ asked Wopole.</p>

<p>‘Because it’s all there is to eat in the
moon, and if it were hard I shouldn’t
be able to eat it.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Oh, I see; but why don’t you
come to the earth? You’d make your
fortune in a show.’</p>

<p>The Man shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>‘I did try once; but I got my
mouth burnt, and I shan’t try again.’</p>

<p>‘Why, how was that?’ asked
Wopole.</p>

<p>‘Don’t you know the song?’ said
the old Man in astonishment.</p>

<p>‘Not I.’</p>

<p>‘Then I’ll sing it.’</p>

<p>And forthwith he began to sing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘The Man in the Moon</div>
<div class="verse">Came down too soon</div>
<div class="verse">And asked his way to Norwich, O;</div>
<div class="verse">He got sent to the south</div>
<div class="verse">And burnt his mouth</div>
<div class="verse">With eating cold plum-porridge, O.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Man’s voice itself was about
as melodious as that of a peacock;
but in the final ‘O’ of the song he
was joined by his dog and Wopole,
who both sang—or rather bawled—a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
wrong note; and as each was proud
of his voice the ‘O’ was prolonged
indefinitely, and it might have been
kept up till doomsday, only, just at
that moment, they happened to turn
the corner of a heap of cheese and
came in sight of a cottage at some
distance off.</p>

<p>‘That’s the cottage where they live,’
said the old Man.</p>

<p>And no sooner did the Princess
hear his words than she started off
at a run towards it.</p>

<p>‘I must get there before him,’ she
said; and so she went as fast as she
could over the soft cheese. She really
needn’t have hurried so much, for
Wopole and the old man had stopped,
and it might have saved her a world
of trouble if she had listened to what
they said; but she didn’t.</p>

<p>When she reached the cottage she
stopped a moment to gain breath;
but that was soon done, and she
went to the door and tapped. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
answer came; so she lifted the latch
gently and walked in as quietly as she
could.</p>

<p>‘There goes that door,’ she heard
an ill-tempered voice say.</p>

<p>‘I shouldn’t take the trouble to
close it again if I were you. It’s the
fifth time it’s blown open to-day.’ This
was in another voice.</p>

<p>It was impossible for the Princess
to see where the voice came from,
for the cottage was so dark after the
light outside that for some moments
it was quite as black as night. However,
gradually her eyes became accustomed
to the twilight, for the
open door did let in a good deal
of light.</p>

<p>What she did see, however, did
not please her eyes much, for the
three sisters, to whom Wopole gave
the name of Parker—they are called
the Parcae generally—were about as
ugly as they make them; and as they
were twins—that is, triplets—there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
was not much to choose between
them.</p>

<p>The room in the cottage was very
large, and at the wall at one end a
large number of frames stood on
which were nailed reels, and from
every reel came a silver thread, and
over every reel a small placard was
placed on which was written a name—the
name of the owner of the thread.</p>

<p>Behind the frames stood one of
the Fates, who took off used-up reels
and placed new ones in their stead;
though how she did it the Princess
could not tell, for the Fates, as well
as Love, are blind. Yet she did it.</p>

<p>Between the reels and the last of
the three sisters sat one clothed in
black, who held in her hand scissors
wherewith she severed certain of the
threads—threads of those that die on
earth. Last of the three sat one who
twisted all the threads into one great
rope that ran from her hands down
a fathomless pit to the earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>And so they all sat silently working
busily, with no other sound than the
clipping of the scissors as their owner
cut remorselessly here and there,
surely and safely—she needed no
eyes.</p>

<p>But the Princess heeded little of
this, for she was seeking out two
names. The names were arranged
in townships, so she had but little
difficulty in finding them; and she
changed the names that stood over
the strings. Over Wopole’s she put
the name of Treblo, and over Treblo
she put Wopole’s name.</p>

<p>‘It is the only way to stop him
killing Treblo. As for the others,
Abbonamento and Araminta, if Wopole
cuts his own string and dies,
he will not be able to cut theirs;
but if he die not instantly and cut
the other strings, I will knot them
together again quickly. And I will
also knot together Wopole’s own
thread, for he has done me no harm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
and once he saved my life; only, he
must not kill Treblo.’</p>

<p>When she had got thus far, the
light that came through the door was
interrupted for a moment, and Wopole
entered.</p>

<p>He stopped for a few minutes to
accustom his eyes to the faint light.
Then the Princess heard him mutter:</p>

<p>‘Lucky for me the old ladies are
blind and deaf. Here are his own
scissors to cut his own thread. That
is to fight him with his own tools—and
I shall win.’</p>

<p>And then he walked towards the
sets of threads.</p>

<p>In a few moments he had found
the thread marked ‘Treblo,’ and
reaching out the scissors he cut it
through. But he dropped the scissors
almost instantly.</p>

<p>‘What a pain I have in my side,’
he said. ‘I won’t cut any more
threads if it’s to hurt me like this
each time. Old Abbonamento and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Araminta won’t last long after their
son; and as for the lovely Princess,
Mumkie promised her to me, so I
won’t cut your string, Ernalie.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you,’ said Ernalie herself,
so quietly that Wopole did not notice
it, and he left the house in somewhat
of a hurry.</p>

<p>‘I’ll just join his thread, and then
I’ll join him again; and so there’s not
much harm done.’</p>

<p>But it was not quite so easy to join
the threads as it looked, for part of
the thread that went towards the earth
moved on, while that which came from
the reel stood still. However, she
pulled the thread rapidly from the reel,
and she managed to tie the two parts
together before they reached the lady
with the scissors, and so the thread
passed on its way without notice.</p>

<p>‘That’s all right,’ said she thankfully,
and she left the house to follow
Wopole.</p>

<p>He, however, had already passed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
turning and was out of sight, so she
followed; but when she too had turned
the corner he was nowhere to be seen.
However, she was quite sure of the
road, so she went leisurely on; but each
hillock was so like the other, and there
was no mark to guide her, for no trees
grew on the cheese. And so little by
little she began to feel convinced that
she had lost her way, and though she
wandered on for hours and hours she
came to no trace of anything that would
guide her to the vessel.</p>

<p>But at last she came to some
footsteps in the cheese, and she was
now quite sure of being in the right
track. So she ran on as fast as she could,
and she really was on the right path, and
soon she came in sight of the sea, and
then she saw the vessel, but it was
sailing away from her as fast as it
could, and although she shouted and
cried to Wopole to come back and
fetch her, he took no notice.</p>

<p>‘Wopole! Wopole!’ she shrieked;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
but the wind carried her voice away,
and did not bring back Wopole.</p>

<p>Again she called:</p>

<p>‘Wopole!’</p>

<p>‘What <i>is</i> the use of making all
that noise?’ said a voice that came
from close to her side, and when she
looked round she saw the Man, sitting
on his bundle of sticks, eating the
bread ravenously, and scooping up
pieces of the moon-cheese from his
side.</p>

<p>‘What is the use of making all
that noise?’ he said again, bad-temperedly.</p>

<p>‘I want Wopole to come back and
fetch me,’ said the Princess.</p>

<p>‘I daresay he’d feel flattered if he
knew; but he doesn’t. It’s no use
howling. By the bye, I forgot to tell
you—“This lanthorn doth the horned
moon present.”’</p>

<p>‘But what <i>has</i> that got to do
with my getting home?’ said the
Princess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I don’t know; but it’s my home.
Look, the sea’s rising.’</p>

<p>The Princess looked round in alarm,
for she was afraid of getting her feet
wet; but though the sea was rising, it
did not hurt the moon at all, for, you
see, the water belonged to the earth,
and so, while the moon sank lower
and lower, the water remained like
a solid wall above them, but did not
close over them. The light of the
moon attracted the fishes and strange
monsters of the deep, and the Princess
saw them as calmly as if they had been
part of a large aquarium. She looked
at them for some time; but a strange
sound behind her made her turn
round:</p>

<p>‘I am about to sing a serenade,’ said
the Man.</p>

<p>‘Please don’t,’ said the Princess.</p>

<p>‘I’m sure you’d like to hear it.
“I’ll sing you songs of Araby,”’ he
said.</p>

<p>‘But I don’t care about Araby.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>‘You really must listen. Come,
now, do hear.’</p>

<p>And he began waving his arms to
and fro, roaring:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘When moonlight o’er the azure seas</div>
<div class="verse">In soft effulgence swells!’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">But he sang it to the tune of the
moonlight sonata.</p>

<p>The Princess did not wait to hear.
She put her fingers in her ears, and
ran off as fast as she could; but still
she heard the burden:</p>

<div class="center">
‘Ah, Angeline! ah, lady mine!’<br />
</div>

<p class="unindent">And he seemed to keep it up for a
long while. However, after she had
gone some miles the sound died away
in the distance, and all was quiet.</p>

<p>The Princess now sat down to rest,
and to look at the earth, for the
moon had dipped underneath it by
this time, and she could see Australia
and New Zealand and various of the
other lands of the Antipodes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>Her attention was drawn away from
the earth to the moon by a sound
that seemed like the rolling of wheels.
It was still distant, but approached
rapidly, and in a few moments a
chariot, drawn by two milk-white stags
with golden horns, dashed past close
to her, and rolled over a hill near by,
as easily as if they had been bubbles
blown by the wind.</p>

<p>But the Princess did not look much
at the stags or the chariot; the thing
that took her attention was the driver.
A woman you could hardly have called
her; for, though she was clad in the
garb of a huntress, it was easy to see
who she was, for who but Diana
carried a silver bow?</p>

<p>‘Dear me!’ said Ernalie, ‘this must
be the Goddess of the moon. I’ll go
to her and tell her everything, and ask
her to take me back to the earth when
she goes. For she must go to the
earth sometimes since she’s the Goddess
of the chase; there’s nothing to hunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
here except cheese-mites, and they’re
not great sport for such a mighty
huntress.’</p>

<p>So she followed as fast as she was
able to the top of the hill over which
the chariot had disappeared; but it
had gone so fast that it had passed out
of sight over another range of hills.
However, the hoof and wheel marks
were plainly shown on the white surface
of the cheese. So she went on
and on, following the tracks, until, just
as she was beginning to despair, she
came to the brow of a hill, and in
a valley beneath she saw a large
building, in appearance something like
a Grecian temple, except that instead
of stone it was made of cheese.</p>

<p>In front of the building was a large
heap of skins of various animals, piled
up so high that they made a sort of
couch on which the Goddess was lying
up to dinner; for it was the fashion
among the gods to lie up or rather
down, instead of sitting up to table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>The two white stags which had
been harnessed to the chariot were
playfully butting at each other with
their golden horns, and the chariot
itself was tilted on its back, just as
you would see an ordinary two-wheeled
cart nowadays.</p>

<p>But the Princess was not particularly
interested in this—to tell
the truth, she was feeling remarkably
hungry and thirsty, for she had been
already for some hours without tasting
anything at all.</p>

<p>‘I wonder if I’m invisible to
the gods as well as to man,’ she
thought. ‘I’ll just try if I am, at
all events.’</p>

<p>So she went towards the Goddess,
who was eating the food that lay
on the table in front of the couch;
but Diana did not appear to notice
her, and she advanced more boldly
until she was quite close to the
table.</p>

<p>‘She doesn’t seem to have much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
variety,’ thought the Princess, at least
she meant to think.</p>

<p>‘Do you think so?’ said Diana,
looking up in some astonishment to
where the voice came from. ‘And
who asked you to say so? and who
are you, and where are you, and why
can’t I see you? Tell me, or I’ll
shoot you.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t exactly see how you can,’
said the Princess.</p>

<p>The Goddess seized her bow and
looked for her quiver; but even as
she reached out her hand to take it,
it vanished, for Ernalie was too fast
for her.</p>

<p>Diana looked more and more astonished
and annoyed.</p>

<p>‘Who are you?’ she said. ‘Are
you a mortal?’</p>

<p>‘Certainly I am,’ said Ernalie.</p>

<p>‘Then how is it I can’t see you?’
asked the Goddess.</p>

<p>‘Because of the feather, I suppose,’
said the Princess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>‘You don’t mean to say you’ve
got the feather? Tell me how you
got it?’</p>

<p>The Princess did as she was told,
for she saw no use in making the
Goddess angry.</p>

<p>When she had finished, Diana said:</p>

<p>‘You have been lucky, whoever you
are. The feather belonged to one of
Jupiter’s eagles, and this eagle got
angry and flew at Jove because he
gave its brother eagle more than its
share of food. So he banished the
eagle to the earth, and it got shot.
I would give anything for the feather.’</p>

<p>‘But I wouldn’t part with it for any
price,’ said Ernalie.</p>

<p>‘I’ll give you anything you like for
it, you know,’ said the Goddess.</p>

<p>‘But I won’t part with it,’ said
Ernalie. ‘Besides, I’ve got your
arrows, and I won’t give them back
to you for nothing.’</p>

<p>‘What a plague you are! What do
you want for the arrows?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>‘First, you must promise not to
steal the feather from me.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I’ll promise that,’ said the
Goddess.</p>

<p>‘Then promise not to do me any
harm.’</p>

<p>‘Very well.’</p>

<p>‘And lastly, take me safely back to
the earth.’</p>

<p>‘I should be only too glad if you
had never come near me,’ said the
Goddess. ‘However, I promise them
all. Now give me the arrows.’</p>

<p>The Princess gave the arrows back,
for the word of Diana was not to be
doubted.</p>

<p>‘I wish you would show yourself
to me,’ the Goddess went on; ‘I
should like to see you very much.
I wonder what sort of a person you
are? Do show yourself.’</p>

<p>So the Princess took off the cap
in which she wore the feather, but
as soon as it was off Diana vanished;
for, you see, it was the feather touching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
her head that gave Ernalie the power
of seeing without being seen, and a
goddess is naturally invisible. But the
Princess did not think of that.</p>

<p>‘It must be some trick,’ she thought.
So she put the feather back in a hurry,
but the Goddess had not moved. She
was smiling quietly.</p>

<p>‘Can’t you trust me, child?’ she
said; ‘for you aren’t much more than
a child, you know.’</p>

<p>‘I’m grown up, at any rate,’ said
the Princess indignantly. ‘I’m nineteen
years old, so I’m not so very
young.’</p>

<p>‘And I’m nineteen thousand years
old,’ said the Goddess, ‘and I don’t
look so very old, do I?’</p>

<p>‘You certainly don’t. But then,
you see, you’re a goddess and I’m a
mortal, and it makes a difference.’</p>

<p>‘It does,’ said Diana. ‘But do
show yourself to me again.’</p>

<p>‘But if I make myself visible, you
disappear,’ said Ernalie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Oh, I had forgotten that. However,
I’ll make myself visible too.’</p>

<p>So when Ernalie took the feather
away this time Diana was easily visible.</p>

<p>‘And you want to go back to the
earth, do you?’ asked Diana.</p>

<p>‘I do, very much,’ answered the
Princess.</p>

<p>‘And why?’</p>

<p>‘Because the moon has got so little
to eat on it.’</p>

<p>‘Really!’ said the Goddess. ‘There’s
plenty of cheese, isn’t there?’</p>

<p>‘But I don’t like cheese, and especially
green cheese. I hate it.’</p>

<p>‘Do you, really? What a pity it is
you’re not a mouse,’ said the Goddess.</p>

<p>‘But I’m not,’ said Ernalie, ‘and
that settles it.’</p>

<p>‘She might offer me some of her
food,’ she thought to herself.</p>

<p>‘You wouldn’t be able to eat it if
you had it,’ said the Goddess, who
seemed to hear what she thought just
as well as what she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Why shouldn’t I?’ asked Ernalie.</p>

<p>‘Because it’s ambrosia; and if you
once ate any of it you’d never be
able to eat any other kind of food,
which would be rather awkward for
you.’</p>

<p>‘Why?’ asked the Princess.</p>

<p>‘You’re always asking “Y.” Why
don’t you use some other letter—“Z”
for instance; it gets so monotonous.
Now tell me who you are, and all
about yourself.’</p>

<p>So the Princess did as she was
told.</p>

<p>‘It would never do to offend her
if she’s going to take me back to the
earth,’ she thought, and the Goddess
remarked:</p>

<p>‘Quite right.’</p>

<p>When she had finished, the Goddess
said:</p>

<p>‘You shouldn’t have interfered with
the Fates. Even Jupiter daren’t do
that, and I’d as soon go near them as
I would pat Cerberus.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>‘But what could I do? I didn’t
want Wopole to kill himself.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t see why not,’ said the Goddess.
‘Why did you come at all?
If Wopole and the other chose to fall
out I don’t see why you should meddle
to save him.’</p>

<p>‘But I couldn’t let Wopole kill
Treblo.’</p>

<p>‘Why not?’ asked the Goddess.</p>

<p>‘Because he was my foster-brother,
and he was going to marry me, and
I’m sure I didn’t want my husband
to be liable to drop down dead at any
moment.’</p>

<p>The Goddess looked angry at this.</p>

<p>‘Why shouldn’t he? He’s only
a man, and I hate men—nasty,
vulgar things! And you were going
to marry him? If I’d known that
I’d never have spoken a word to
you. Don’t you know I’m the Goddess
of Chastity, and I’ve sworn never
to marry? The sooner you go the
better.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>‘But I can’t go. I’ve got nowhere
to go to; and besides, you promised
to take me back to the earth,’ said
Ernalie.</p>

<p>‘I suppose I did,’ said the Goddess.
‘Besides, I don’t want to have you
always here. Well, the moon will
begin to rise in half an hour, and then
I’ll take you in my chariot, that’s the
only thing to do; so you can help me
to harness the stags.’</p>

<p>This was soon done, and the Goddess
went into the house to put away
the remains of the food on which she
had been dining. When she came
out again Ernalie noticed that she had
made a considerable change in her
costume. What the change was I
don’t exactly know, but she said to
Ernalie:</p>

<p>‘You see I have to dress lightly to
follow the chase easily. However, if
you’re ready, I am.’</p>

<p>So saying, she slung her quiver full
of arrows over her back, and taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
the silver bow in her hand, got into
the chariot.</p>

<p>‘Get up,’ she said to Ernalie, for
the stags were already pawing the
ground in their eagerness to be off.
Ernalie jumped in quickly, and the
stags darted off at an immense pace.
They went so smoothly, however,
that the Princess was not at all
shaken or jolted. On over hills and
through valleys, until it almost made
her head swim at the way in which
the scenery shot past. However, in
a few minutes the roar of the waves
sounded in her ears, and they came
over the hill-top to the sea-beach.
Just then the Goddess drew the reins
in, and the stags stopped short.</p>

<p>‘What on earth is that?’ she said.</p>

<p>Now that the chariot had stopped,
the Princess too could hear the sound
that came faintly borne on the breeze:</p>

<p class="center">
‘When moonlight o’er the azure seas.’<br />
</p>

<p>‘Why, it’s the Man,’ she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>‘So it is,’ said Diana angrily. ‘I
recognise his voice. He calls it
“mezzo-soprano.” It’s dreadful. I told
him never to sing unless he had somebody
to sing to. Of course I thought
no one would ever come to the moon.
I wonder whom he’s singing to?’</p>

<p>‘I rather imagine he thinks he’s
singing to me,’ said the Princess hesitatingly.
‘I begged him not to sing;
but he insisted. So I ran away, and I
suppose he thinks I’m still there, for,
you see, he can’t see me.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, he thinks you’re still there,
does he?’ said Diana. ‘Just make
yourself invisible, and I’ll do the same,
and we’ll go a little closer.’</p>

<p>The Princess did as she was told,
and Diana urged the stags in the
direction of the voice.</p>

<p>The rattling of the wheels was quite
drowned in the noise of the Man’s
voice, as he sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘And you’ll remember me . . e . . e,</div>
<div class="verse">And you’ll remember me.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>‘You’ve improved a good deal in
that last line,’ said the Goddess. ‘I
wish you’d sing it over again.’</p>

<p>‘You <i>are</i> there then?’ said the Man.
‘I thought you had gone away. I
couldn’t get you to answer when I
spoke to you.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! that was because I was too
enchanted for words to express. Now,
<i>do</i> sing the last line again. Only the
last line; it <i>is</i> so fine,’ said Diana.</p>

<p>The Man drew in a long breath:</p>

<p class="center">
‘And you’ll remember, re . member me . e . e.’<br />
</p>

<p>At the sound of his voice the Princess
put her hands to her ears, and Diana
had the greatest difficulty in keeping
the stags from turning tail and bolting
right away. However, she managed to
quieten them, and took a good grip
of her whip handle, and the consequence
was that the last line came out:</p>

<p class="center">
‘And you’ll remember me . . e . . ow—ow!’<br />
</p>

<p class="unindent">for the whip stung a good deal.</p>

<p>‘I hope you’ll remember me—ow—ow,’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
said the Goddess calmly, as she
suddenly appeared to him, turning the
chariot towards the sea.</p>

<p>‘You don’t mind getting a little wet?’
she continued, turning to the Princess.
‘We’re going over the water.’</p>

<p>And she gave the reins to the stags,
who sprang wildly down the steep
slope into the sea. For a moment
the Princess thought that there might
be rather too much of a good thing,
even if that good thing were riding in
a chariot along with a goddess; for
the chariot plunged deep into a high
wave, and it seemed to the Princess
as if it never did intend to come to
the surface again. However, it did
come up, and that was some comfort,
although the Princess was dripping all
over with the sea-water.</p>

<p>But the stags were once more darting
onwards, for the chariot ran as
lightly over the waves as over the land,
and they went at such a rate that
although the great breakers chased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
them, and even curled right over
them, they were never so much as
touched by the spray that the wind
blew from off the crests of the waves.</p>

<p>So they dashed on through the blue
water that coiled up over the front of
the chariot but fell back when it saw
the Goddess. On and on they went,
and as they got farther out the waves
became steeper and steeper, until it
seemed as if they were going over very
mountainous land indeed, for they
rose over every wave.</p>

<p>Suddenly the Goddess said:</p>

<p>‘This is a little too much,’ and drew
the stags in.</p>

<p>The great waves rolled on like angry
hounds hungering for their prey; but
the Goddess motioned with her hand:</p>

<p>‘Down, down!’ she cried. ‘Know
ye me?’</p>

<p>And the waves sank, like hounds to
whom their master shows his whip,
and instantly it fell a deep calm over
the whole sea. Then the Goddess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
lashed on the deer again, and once
more they sped on over the sea, and
the chariot wheels cut two deep white
furrows in the deep blue, and in the
moonlight Ernalie could see the two
straight white lines glistening right
away to the horizon—for they went so
quickly that there was no time for the
foam to die away, before it was out
of sight. So they kept on for a long
while, and gradually the moon rose in
the sky, and then fell lower and lower,
and still they journeyed on. Then the
moon set, the stars gradually faded
from sight, and the hot rays of the
morning sun began to turn the eastern
sky yellow.</p>

<p>Suddenly the Goddess pulled up the
stags.</p>

<p>‘There’s the land,’ she said, pointing
to a low blue line on the horizon.
‘We must rise into the air now, for we
are getting near the place where ships
ply to and fro on the sea, and if the
sailors saw the two white trails of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
chariot wheels they would say it was
the sea-serpent, and I don’t want to be
called a snake—it’s most insulting.
So if you’re inclined to be giddy
you’d better sit in the bottom of the
car.’</p>

<p>But the Princess said:</p>

<p>‘Oh no. I’m never giddy, however
great the height may be.’</p>

<p>So Diana gave the word to the
stags, and they began to rise from the
water in a spiral line upwards as an
eagle soars in chase of a swan.</p>

<p>When they had reached a sufficiently
great height, the Goddess once more let
loose the reins, and the deer bounded
forward again like an arrow released
from a bow.</p>

<p>Swiftly they neared the land; but
from where they were nothing could
be seen of the things on it. Everything
was blurred into one mass, as if
it had been a map spread out below
them.</p>

<p>So they sped on again for a time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
and the fresh morning air blew cool
on Ernalie’s face, and almost made
her shiver, though by this time her
garments were dry again, and blew
out like a cloud behind her, as if they
had been of thin gauze, though they
were really of far thicker and heavier
material.</p>

<p>Suddenly a thought struck Ernalie.</p>

<p>‘Where are you going to take me?’
she asked as well as she could, for
the wind blew her words down her
throat.</p>

<p>The Goddess smiled somewhat maliciously,
Ernalie thought, and checked
the course of the stags that she might
speak with greater ease.</p>

<p>‘You shall see,’ she said.</p>

<p>‘But I should like to know beforehand.’</p>

<p>‘I only promised to take you back
to the earth,’ said Diana.</p>

<p>‘But you promised to do me no
harm,’ said Ernalie dismally, ‘and if
you leave me in the middle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
a desert you’ll do me a lot of
harm.’</p>

<p>‘But I’m not going to put you
down into the middle of a desert,’ said
Diana. ‘Look, we are descending.
Now, see if you recognise the country
you pass over.’</p>

<p>The Princess looked over the edge
of the chariot, and she saw that the
stags were descending in great spiral
curves, and at each curve the earth
flew up nearer and nearer to meet
them. As they got lower down
Ernalie could see what was below
more clearly, as if she had been
looking through an opera glass, and
was only just commencing to get the
right focus. When they were quite
close the Goddess stopped the descent
of the chariot.</p>

<p>‘Now, do you recognise where you
are?’ she asked.</p>

<p>But Ernalie shook her head.</p>

<p>‘I only see that we are over the
tops of a range of mountains that have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
snow on their peaks,’ she said. ‘But
I was never here before—that I am
quite certain of.’</p>

<p>The Goddess shook the reins, and
again the stags flew forward; but this
time not so fast as they had gone
before.</p>

<p>‘You have been here before,’ she
said. ‘And at just this height, and
at just this speed, only you were going
in the opposite direction.’</p>

<p>‘Why,’ said Ernalie, ‘I must be in
my own country. Oh, how cruel of
you to take me away from my Prince,
and you promised to do me no
harm.’</p>

<p>‘I am doing you no harm,’ said the
Goddess. ‘To prevent you marrying
is not harm—it is good.’</p>

<p>But the Princess said:</p>

<p>‘No! no! it is harm. I would give
anything to be back with him.’</p>

<p>‘Would you give your feather?’ said
the Goddess eagerly.</p>

<p>‘No, not that,’ said the Princess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I will give you anything you like
for it,’ said the Goddess. ‘Anything——’</p>

<p>But the Princess said scornfully:</p>

<p>‘Not so, Goddess. I will get back
to my love in spite of you. If I can
do nothing better I will pray to Venus
and offer her the feather.’</p>

<p>The Goddess looked angrily at her,
and it almost seemed as if her eyes
shot fire.</p>

<p>‘If it were not for my promise,’
she said, ‘I would hurl you from the
car; but as it is, I will put you safely
down.’</p>

<p>But the Princess smiled in spite of
herself.</p>

<p>‘Do you, then, hate Venus so
much, great Goddess?’ she asked.
‘Well, you have really done me much
good, and therefore I promise never to
give the feather to any other goddess
save you alone.’</p>

<p>Diana looked very much relieved;
for, to tell the truth, the goddesses in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
those days were very jealous of one
another, and Diana could not bear the
thought that any one else should have
the feather if she could not get it.</p>

<p>So for a few minutes she was silent;
and then suddenly she drew in the
stags.</p>

<p>‘I am going to set you down here,’
she said, and they plunged into the
darkness below. For you must know
that though they were high up, and
the rays of the sun, still below the
horizon, fell on them, yet, beneath
them, everything was dark in the
shadow of the mountains.</p>

<p>The chariot sank slowly until it
rested on the ground, but it was still
so dark that the Princess could see
nothing.</p>

<p>‘Get out,’ said Diana; ‘you are
quite safe here.’ And the Princess
obeyed. ‘Now remember,’ the Goddess
went on, ‘I have kept my
promises. Remember to keep yours.
Give the feather to no one except to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
me, unless I send Iris for it. To her
alone give it, for she is the messenger
of the goddesses.’</p>

<p>The Princess once more promised,
and Diana shook the reins, and the
chariot once more darted up through
the air and out of the lower darkness
into the sunlight, until it was so high
that it vanished altogether from her
sight.</p>

<p>So the Princess looked wearily down
again, and the earth around her seemed
doubly dark by contrast.</p>

<p>‘I wonder where on earth I am,’
she said, and then she took two or
three steps forward, but she came
against a stone parapet or wall, or
something. ‘I wonder what this is,’
she said to herself. ‘I think I shall
stop where I am till daylight; it won’t
be very long now, and I’m safe here
at any rate.’</p>

<p>So she leant on the wall and waited;
but even though the dawn was near
it seemed long in coming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>But presently over the mountains
in the east a yellow light stole, changing
the silence of darkness for the
clamorous speech of light, and the
river flowing placidly in front was
turned to liquid gold with the yellow
of the dawn, and a sense of yellow-fringed
gray mist was on everything,
and forms erstwhile veiled discovered
themselves.</p>

<p>‘Why, wherever am I?’ said Ernalie,
rubbing her eyes in astonishment. ‘I
seem to have been here before! Yes,
there’s the fountain and the rose-bushes,
and—why, this must be the
terrace of my father’s Palace! Just
where I was when the eagle carried
me off. I wonder if the swans are
still here,’ and she walked to the other
side of the terrace and looked over the
marble parapet into the water.</p>

<p>‘Yes, there they are.’ And on the
marble steps that led down to the
water the swans were asleep, each on
one leg, with its neck coiled up on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
its back, and head under its wing.
On hearing the footsteps of the Princess
one of them looked lazily up as
if it had been waked too soon, and
then it shook its head, yawned, put
down its other leg and waddled slowly
to the water, into which it jumped
with a splash that woke the others
up; and they followed dreamily, being
unused to the chill of the water so
early.</p>

<p>A cock crowed, and his challenge
was answered from far and near, and
woke up the sparrows, who came down
to the fountain for a shower-bath in
the sparkling spray. They were followed
by the pigeons, who, after
cooing a little, stretched their wings
and circled away on their morning
flight. So, by degrees, the world
awoke as the day took a firmer
grasp on the land and the light grew
stronger.</p>

<p>‘I wish they’d open the doors and
let me get in,’ the Princess said. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
as yet there seemed no sign of any
one waking up.</p>

<p>‘Ah, well,’ she said resignedly, ‘I’ve
waited six years to come home—I
suppose I can wait a few more
hours.’</p>

<p>So she quietly walked to the rose-bushes
and plucked one or two of
the great red damask roses, and
chafing the petals off between her
hands, threw the handfuls of them
at the swans, who hissed and snapped
as the mass of red leaves fell over
them. It was some time since they
had been subjected to such treatment;
however, they seemed to get used to
it again pretty easily.</p>

<p>Thus the Princess managed to while
away about half an hour, and then she
noticed smoke coming out of one of
the chimneys.</p>

<p>‘They must be up in the kitchen,’
she thought. ‘I’ll just go and knock
at the door and get let in.’</p>

<p>Accordingly she went and knocked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
softly at the door, and an angry voice
shouted out:</p>

<p>‘Come in, do! and don’t stand
knocking there. I’ve got the King’s
boots to black, and his eggs and
bacon to cook, and I’ve only got
three hours to do it in. I haven’t
got time.’</p>

<p>So the Princess lifted the latch and
walked in.</p>

<p>‘Is the King up, cook?’ she asked.</p>

<p>‘No, he’s not! lazy old man as he
is,’ said the cook, looking up angrily.
‘But where are you? Come out from
behind that door.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! I had forgotten,’ said the
Princess.</p>

<p>She meant, of course, she had forgotten
about the feather, but the cook
didn’t know that.</p>

<p>‘You’d forgotten, had you?’ she
exclaimed. ‘I’ll teach you to forget if
I catch you!’</p>

<p>‘But you won’t, my dear cook,’ said
the Princess sweetly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>‘You’ll catch it if you don’t look
out!’ howled the cook, as she rose
from the floor where she had been
cleaning the boots, and in doing so
she knocked over an enormous pot
of liquid blacking.</p>

<p>‘That’s your doing!’ she cried, as
she made a dash at the door.</p>

<p>But the Princess evaded her easily,
and she ran outside fully expecting
to find the invisible questioner there.
But the Princess meanwhile walked
through the kitchen and up the back-stairs
to her own room.</p>

<p>The room was just as she had left
it when she went away, except that
the bed seemed to have grown rather
small for her, or rather she had grown
too large for the bed.</p>

<p>However, she went in, and locking
the door, laid herself down on
the bed, and soon dropped off to
sleep; for, as you may imagine, she
was rather tired, for she had not
slept for nearly two days—that is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
ever since she had first reached the
moon.</p>

<p>It did not seem that she had slept
three minutes before she was awakened
by a tremendous noise below-stairs.</p>

<p>‘I wonder what that is,’ she said.
‘I think I’ll get up and see.’</p>

<p>And she went to the wash-hand
stand to wash the sea-water off her
face, but the soap, from long want
of use, had cracked in all directions,
and she had to content herself with
the water that was in the jug. Then
she brushed her hair, which was full
of salt, and after that tried to brush
the salt off her dress; for the sea-water
had dried on it, and had left
it shining all over with the salt. Before
she had quite finished, however,
the noise that had waked her sounded
again. It seemed as if some one were
running downstairs very hard.</p>

<p>So the Princess took her hat off,
not wishing to be invisible any
more, for a time at least, and then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
opening the door, she walked quietly
downstairs.</p>

<p>There seemed to be no one about,
and except that a terrible hurly-burly
proceeded from the whereabouts of
the kitchen, one would never have
told that any one in the whole house
was awake.</p>

<p>However, just then the clock in
the hall struck eight, and a page came
rushing downstairs.</p>

<p>‘Breakfast! breakfast!’ he shouted,
quite without noticing the Princess,
and he almost passed her before he
saw her; but she stopped him.</p>

<p>‘Where is the King?’ she said.</p>

<p>‘The King is in his counting—that
is, I mean the breakfast-room. But
you can’t see him.’</p>

<p>‘But I must,’ said the Princess.</p>

<p>‘Well, of course, if you must——’</p>

<p>The Princess interrupted him.</p>

<p>‘Don’t you know who I am?’ she
said.</p>

<p>‘No, I don’t; and I don’t want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
to,’ said the page. ‘Perhaps you’re
the person who brings home the washing,
or the kitchen-maid. If you are,
I wouldn’t like to be in your shoes.
The King is so jolly wild about his
eggs and bacon being late that——’</p>

<p>But the Princess didn’t wait to hear
any more; she walked straight towards
the door of the breakfast-room. At
the door two guards were stationed;
but as they were old and crusted—that
is, trusted—they remembered the
Princess, and only saluted with their
swords, wishing her ‘good-morning’—for
they were far too well bred to
express surprise or joy at sight of
her. One of them opened the door
for her, and said in a loud voice:</p>

<p>‘The Princess, your Majesty.’</p>

<p>The King was seated in a chair
with his back to the door, and did not
seem to hear what the man said. He
only nodded, and did not look up from
the papers he was reading.</p>

<p>So the Princess stole quietly up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
behind him, and put her fingers over
his eyes—she always was rather irreverent.</p>

<p>‘Guess who I am,’ she said to the
struggling monarch.</p>

<p>‘I won’t,’ he spluttered, for he was
rather enraged.</p>

<p>‘Think a minute, papa,’ she said
encouragingly.</p>

<p>‘I never should have thought of
being assaulted in such a way,’ said
the King, who had given up struggling,
finding it no use.</p>

<p>So the Princess drew her hands
away, and kissed him on the top of
his bald head.</p>

<p>The King darted away out of the
chair as soon as he was released, and
that so violently that he fell right on
to the floor in a sitting posture.</p>

<p>‘Why, who the——’ he was beginning;
but his eye happening to fall
on Ernalie, he ejaculated:</p>

<p>‘Good gracious! How did you
come here?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I walked downstairs from my room
to bid you good-morning, papa, and
you recoiled when I touched you as
if I were a snake, instead of your
loving daughter. But wouldn’t you
like me to help you up? It must be
rather uncomfortable sitting there.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I think it would be as
well,’ the King said, after reflecting
a moment. ‘I shouldn’t like any one
to see me in such a posture—it’s
rather undignified for a king.’</p>

<p>So the Princess bent over and began
to help him up; but it was a labour of
some time, for the King was rather
stiff, and just as she had got him half
up a page entered and announced the
breakfast. It was the same page that
had met the Princess on the staircase,
and when he saw the Princess assisting
the King to rise, he rushed forward,
shouting:</p>

<p>‘Help! help! She’s murdering the
King.’</p>

<p>And catching the Princess by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
arm, he pulled her away so roughly
that she had to let go of the King,
who recoiled at the shock, and rolled
under the table on his back.</p>

<p>Alarmed at the page’s cries for help,
a large number of people had rushed
in, and he turned to them expecting
to be commended for his bravery; but
he saw that every one either looked as
if he had put his foot in it, or else
was trying hard not to laugh. The
Princess herself could hardly help
laughing at his perplexed face.</p>

<p>‘I think, sir, you were a little too
vigorous in your help,’ she said coldly.
‘You may leave us now.’</p>

<p>‘And you can all go,’ said the King
from under the table.</p>

<p>The whole lot trooped out, shutting
the door, and as soon as they were
outside shouts of laughter filled the
air for some minutes.</p>

<p>The King meanwhile scrambled out
from under the table and got up, this
time declining his daughter’s help.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>‘It’s always the way,’ he said, as
soon as the laughter had died away.
‘Whenever I do anything ridiculous
and undignified there’s always a lot
of people to see it. Why, only last
Thursday—no, last Tuesday, I think—anyhow,
it was the day of the last
state banquet, my crown tumbled into
the soup-tureen, and then I was so
nervous that, when I was raising my
wine-glass to propose a toast, my hand
shook so much that I dropped the
wine down the Duchess of Carabas’s
neck; and then she fainted, and I
helped to carry her out of the room,
and as soon as I got outside they all
laughed so loud that the chandelier
fell into the middle of them. It
broke right on a duke’s head, and he
never apologised for breaking it. However,
I shall get over it now you’ve
come back. We really must get into
more regular habits. I’ve actually
never had more than ten pages to
serve my breakfast since you’ve been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
away, and, by the bye, we’ve not <i>had</i>
breakfast; and I’ve forgotten altogether
to have the bells rung in your
honour. Just knock that gong there
on the table—it’s cracked, but I can’t
afford a new one, and it’s quite good
enough for the guards outside to
hear.’</p>

<p>So the Princess knocked the gong,
and it certainly <i>was</i> cracked; it
sounded a good deal more like knocking
an old pot than a respectable royal
gong.</p>

<p>At the sound one of the guards
outside entered and saluted.</p>

<p>‘Let the breakfast be brought,’ the
King said.</p>

<p>The guard withdrew, and presently
the door opened, and a page appeared
with the royal coffee-pot on a cushion
of cloth of gold. Next came another
page with the cream-jug on a similar
cushion, and then another with the
slop-basin, and another with the sugar,
and another with the tongs, until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
table was completely furnished. Last
of all came, with a loud fanfare of
trumpets, four men, staggering under
the weight of an enormous silver dish
with an equally enormous silver cover.
When this was placed on the table,
amid another flourish of trumpets, the
royal butler entered, and said:</p>

<p>‘Breakfast is served, your Majesty,’
although the King could see it very
well himself. But that was the
custom.</p>

<p>‘You may remove the cover,’ the
King said.</p>

<p>And the butler did so, discovering
the breakfast. I say discovering, for
the breakfast was so small that it
seemed almost lost in the centre of
the great dish. The twelve pages had
ranged themselves in lines of six on
each side of the table, and although
they were very well bred, on the whole
they could not help smiling, whereupon
all simultaneously drew out their handkerchiefs
and began to cough, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
they looked at the windows, as if to
see where the draught came from.</p>

<p>But the King did not take any
notice, and as soon as he could make
himself heard, he said:</p>

<p>‘Ah! and what is this?’</p>

<p>‘It is the breakfast, your Majesty,’
said the butler.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I can see that,’ said the King.
‘But what is the dish called?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, the dish, your Majesty,’ said
the butler apologetically. ‘It’s the
ordinary silver dish that your Majesty
has with the breakfast. I think it’s
the fiddle pattern—no, that’s for
spoons; but——’</p>

<p>‘You’re an ass,’ said the King, interrupting
him angrily.</p>

<p>‘Thank you, your Majesty. Anything
else?’</p>

<p>‘Send for the cook.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, your Majesty. Anything
else?’</p>

<p>‘Yes; go away, and don’t come
back.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Yes, your Majesty. You’re quite
sure there’s nothing——’</p>

<p>‘If you don’t go,’ said the King
threateningly. But he had gone.</p>

<p>In a few minutes heavy footsteps
were heard outside, and the door burst
open violently, and a very fat person
entered. She seemed a perfect mass
of blacking and dust.</p>

<p>‘Who are you?’ said the King in
astonishment.</p>

<p>‘I am the lady that does the cooking
for you,’ said the cook solemnly.</p>

<p>‘Oh, you are,’ said the King; ‘and
will your ladyship allow me to ask
what that is?’ and he pointed to the
breakfast.</p>

<p>The cook went forward and, taking
a fork from the table, tried to pick the
breakfast up, but it slid off the fork;
so, without more ado, she took it
up in her fingers and examined it
carefully, as if to see that it had not
changed since she sent it up. When
she had done, she looked up and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Why, it’s as nice an egg as can
be bought for money, only it’s a bit
addled; and I dropped it in the
blacking, but I wiped it on my own
apron—look there.’</p>

<p>And she lifted up her apron to look
at; and it certainly looked as if a good
many eggs had been wiped on it.</p>

<p>However, the King did not notice
that.</p>

<p>‘Oh, it’s an egg, is it?’ he said; ‘I
didn’t know. I thought it was a piece
of coal, and——’</p>

<p>But at this point the cook broke in.</p>

<p>‘Call my eggs a coal! It’s a crying
shame! You ought to be ashamed of
yourself, an old man like you, too.
Here have I been working for three
hours this very morning at that egg,
and he calls it a coal; and me that
plagued too with demons! Why, only
this morning one of ’em came and
banged at the door so hard that
it broke, and then it came in. It
was a blue one, with red eyes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
a long green tail with a fork at the
end; and it stuck the fork in the
egg, and then put the egg in the
blacking and threw it all over the
kitchen; and then it kicked the blacking
pot over and flew out at the door
before I could say “Gemini”; and I
saw it with my own eyes, and it was
as ugly a little——’</p>

<p>But this was more than the Princess
could stand.</p>

<p>‘Oh, what a—an untruth that is!
Look at me. Am I a blue demon
with red eyes and a tail?’</p>

<p>But the cook was off again.</p>

<p>‘Oh, it was you, was it? And
you ought to be ashamed of <i>your</i>self,
a-frightening a poor lone-lorn woman.
Call yourself a Princess? I call you
a——’</p>

<p>This was too much for the King.</p>

<p>‘That is enough,’ he said. ‘Take
a month’s warning.’</p>

<p>To which the cook replied contemptuously:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>‘You give <i>me</i> a month’s warning?
Not a bit of it. I give you a minute’s
warning! it’s quite enough for the
likes of you.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, very well,’ said the King. ‘Of
course, if you go off without warning,
I don’t pay your month’s wages.’</p>

<p>‘Call yourself a King?’ roared
the cook. ‘Why, you’re meaner
than——’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know what I call myself,’
said the King mildly, ‘but if you
don’t go I’ll call a policeman and
have your head cut off instead of
your wages.’</p>

<p>But the cook was not to be
daunted.</p>

<p>‘That’s what the likes of you does
with your old and faithful servants.
Here have I been, day in, day out,
work, work, work, like a nigger slave-driver,
and this is my reward!’</p>

<p>The King did not listen to the rest.
He beckoned to one of the pages and
said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Just run and bring a sack and
throw it over her head. Be quick!’</p>

<p>The page left the room.</p>

<p>‘There you go,’ said the irrepressible
cook. ‘That’s it, send for the police,
ye oppressors of the poor. Ugh!’</p>

<p>And she began a fresh volley of
abuse. She seemed as if she would
never lose her breath. But after a
few minutes—it seemed ages to the
unfortunate King—the page returned;
and although he did not enter very
quietly, yet the cook was making such
a noise that she did not hear him,
and the page, who seemed to enter
entirely into the spirit of the thing,
dropped the sack quietly over her head,
and stopped her flow of language.</p>

<p>‘Now, take her outside and put her
out at the back door, and mind and
shut the door securely after her,’ remarked
the King, with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>Six of the pages immediately caught
hold of her and dragged her out, and
the other six were about to follow to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
see the sport when the King stopped
them.</p>

<p>‘Can any one of you cook at all?’
he said.</p>

<p>One of the pages stood out and
professed to be able to do a little in
that way.</p>

<p>‘Well, then,’ said the King decidedly,
‘all six of you go to the
kitchen and see what you can find
there; and mind you, if I don’t have
a breakfast in five minutes, I’ll—well,
<i>I’ll</i> see about it.’</p>

<p>When the pages had gone, he turned
to the Princess and said:</p>

<p>‘That’s what I always have to put
up with. Only the other day the man
who cleans the library windows flung
his towel in my face and refused to
work any more for me, and all because
I told him that his coat wasn’t in the
fashion.’</p>

<p>‘But wasn’t that rather an unwise
proceeding, papa?’ asked Ernalie,
dubiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Do you think so?’ asked the King.
‘If I said that the cut of your dress
was rather outlandish—and it is, by
the bye—you wouldn’t fling something
at me, would you?’</p>

<p>‘No; but then I’m your dutiful
daughter, you see.’</p>

<p>‘Well, but he ought to be my dutiful
son, for I’m the father of my country.’</p>

<p>‘Well, but then, you see, sons are
not always dutiful—daughters always
are.’</p>

<p>‘Or they ought to be,’ said his
Majesty.</p>

<p>‘It’s the same thing, isn’t it?’</p>

<p>‘Do you think so?’ said the King,
in a tone that showed he doubted it.</p>

<p>Just at this moment the pages
entered, bringing the breakfast; and
they sat down to it.</p>

<p>I needn’t say it was much better
than the first one, although I don’t
remember exactly what it consisted
of; however, they did good justice to
it, for Ernalie was rather hungry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>Just as they had finished, the King
threw down his knife and fork and
looked as if he had just remembered
something dreadful.</p>

<p>‘What is the matter, papa?’ asked
the Princess in alarm.</p>

<p>And the King burst out:</p>

<p>‘There, now! I knew I’d forgotten
something!’ he said. ‘Run out, all
six of you,’ he went on, addressing
the pages, ‘and set the joy-bells pealing,
and send messengers throughout
the land. Quick!’</p>

<p>But when they had gone, he calmed
down and said:</p>

<p>‘Now, Ernalie, tell me where you’ve
been.’</p>

<p>So she began and told it all through,
and the King listened quietly till she
had finished. Then he said:</p>

<p>‘Ah! You’ve had some wonderful
adventures, and you’ve come back safe
out of them—only, I should very much
like to see this wonderful feather.’</p>

<p>So the Princess showed him the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
feather in her hat, which she had
laid on a chair; the King looked
at it very carefully, and then he
said:</p>

<p>‘H’m. Looks a very ordinary
feather. How does it work? I should
like to see.’</p>

<p>‘You won’t see much,’ said the
Princess with a smile, as she put it on
and vanished.</p>

<p>The King looked astonished.</p>

<p>‘Why, where are you?’ he said.</p>

<p>‘I’m just where I was before, papa,’
answered the Princess.</p>

<p>‘But I don’t believe it,’ the King
said, and he looked under the table.
‘You’ve hidden yourself behind something—or
some other trick.’</p>

<p>He was rather too startled to think
of what his words meant exactly.</p>

<p>‘You are a sceptical old papa for
any one to have to do with; but I’ll
soon prove it to you.’</p>

<p>And she walked quietly behind his
chair, and blew in his ear, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
a rather rude thing to do, on the
whole.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps that will blow the disbelief
out of your head,’ she said, laughing
to see how her unfortunate father
shook his head in surprise.</p>

<p>‘Oh yes,’ he replied, ‘I’m quite
convinced, and I don’t need any
more; and I’d much rather see what
you’re up to, so just take the feather
off, there’s a good girl.’</p>

<p>And the Princess did as she was
told, and the King said:</p>

<p>‘Ah! there you are. Don’t put it
on again; I’ve had quite enough of it.
Now I can understand how it was that
you did it all. But I can’t understand
why you didn’t let the young man save
himself. You might just as well have
lent him the feather, and let him go
and get drowned.’</p>

<p>‘But I didn’t want him to get
drowned,’ said the Princess.</p>

<p>‘Why not?’ said the King.</p>

<p>‘Because his father and mother took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
me in, and saved me from Wopole,
and it wouldn’t have been a great return
for their kindness to let their only son
be killed, and besides I——’ But
her Royal Highness stopped.</p>

<p>‘You what?’ said her father.</p>

<p>‘I mean he——’ and she stopped
again.</p>

<p>‘Oh, it’s him this time, is it?
What’s the matter with you?’ he said
in astonishment. ‘You don’t mean
to say that you’re in love with one
another? Now I call that too bad.
Here have I promised you to three
dukes, and you’ve gone and fallen in
love with a Prince. Now I shall have
no end of a nuisance with them.’</p>

<p>‘I won’t marry them, at any rate,’
said Ernalie energetically.</p>

<p>‘I don’t want you to marry <i>them</i>—one’s
quite enough at a time.’</p>

<p>‘But I won’t marry one of them,
and I’m the principal person concerned.</p>

<p>And the Princess began to cry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
and that of course softened the heart
of her father.</p>

<p>‘There, there,’ he said, as if he
were soothing a baby. ‘Don’t cry;
you shall marry the Prince, if you can
get him—only it’s rather awkward for
me. I can’t tell the dukes that you’re
engaged to a Prince that can’t be got
at. I’m afraid the only thing to do
will be to have all their heads cut off.
That’ll keep them quiet, at any rate.
If I were you I’d send this young
man a letter to tell him where you
are.’</p>

<p>‘But I’m afraid it wouldn’t reach
him,’ said the Princess.</p>

<p>‘Then I don’t see what’s to be
done,’ said the King perplexedly.
‘However, I shall give a grand ball
to-morrow, and if I were you I should
go and have a dress made at once.
Send for the Court dressmaker, and tell
her that if the dress isn’t ready by
then you’ll turn her out of her place;
and then when you’ve done that go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
into the library, and take a book and
read. I’ve got a whole lot of work to
do this morning; but I shall have
finished by one, and then I shall have
the day to myself.’</p>

<p>‘But can’t I stay with you while
you work? I will be very quiet.’</p>

<p>But the King shook his head.</p>

<p>‘No—there’s a good girl. I’ve got a
whole lot of people to give audience
to, and they’ll take up such a lot of
time congratulating you that I shall
not get a stroke of work done.’</p>

<p>So the Princess went and was
measured for her ball-dress, and then
into the library, and looked about
for a book.</p>

<p>Most of them looked very dry and
uninteresting, so the Princess took one
at a venture.</p>

<p>It was called <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>,
by Geoffrey Chaucer.</p>

<p>‘Chaucer,’ said the Princess to herself,
‘I’ve heard of him. I’ll just take
it on to the terrace and read it in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
arbour. It’s better than sitting in this
stuffy old library.’</p>

<p>So she opened one of the windows
that led on to the steps of the terrace,
and taking the book with her, stepped
out of the room.</p>

<p>On the terrace a peacock was airing
itself with some pea-hens, and when it
saw the Princess it raised its great
fan-like tail to display itself to
greater advantage, then it quivered
all over until the feathers of its tail
rattled one against the other, and the
hens looked admiringly at him, and
then sideways at one another, nodding
their heads and clucking, as if to
say:</p>

<p>‘Ha! what a fine fellow our master
is, and what a splendid tail he’s got.
Much better than that poor human
being’s yellow stuff, which only moves
when the wind blows it.’ And then
they looked contemptuously at the
Princess’s golden hair, and clucked to
each other again, and followed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
peacock, which was strutting away to
another part of the terrace.</p>

<p>So the Princess went and looked
for the swans; but they were busily
engaged right over at the other side of
the lake, turning bottom upwards in
a very undignified manner, and they
refused to come for any amount of
calling.</p>

<p>As there was nothing else to do,
she went and sat down in a shady
nook in the white marble wall, and
began to look at her book.</p>

<p>‘I shall skip the “Introduction”
and the “Prologue”—that’s always
dry. Yes, let’s see, this will do—“The
Knightes Tale.” It hasn’t got
any apostrophe to “Knightes.” That’s
bad grammar, I’m sure. However, I’ll
go on.’</p>

<p>So she settled herself in a comfortable
position with the book on her
lap, and began again:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘Whilom as olde stories tellen us</div>
<div class="verse">A certeyn duk highte Theseus.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>Here she stopped.</p>

<p>‘This man may be a good poet,
but he spells awfully badly. Fancy
“certain” spelt with an “e-y-n,” and
“duke” without an “e.” It sounds
like “duck.” And then, what was
the “height of Theseus”? I can’t
understand it at all.’</p>

<p>However, she read on, skipping
pages here and there, for it was almost
impossible for her to understand it.
Now it happened that as she turned
the pages over listlessly—for she was
thinking of something else—her eye
happened to fall on the name of
‘Dian.’</p>

<p>‘Why, that must be Diana! only
they’ve forgotten the “a.” I’ll look
a little farther and see what it says
about her.’</p>

<p>So she ran her eye down the page,
and sure enough she came upon the
name.</p>

<p>‘Why, it’s spelt with a “y” now,’
she said. ‘Chaucer evidently doesn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
know his own mind in the matter of
spelling. I’ll write to him, and ask
him about it. Now, let’s see what
it says. Why, it appears to be a
prayer, or an invocation, or something.’</p>

<p>So she read:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘O chaste goddes of the woodes greene</div>
<div class="verse">To whence bothe heven and erthe are seene</div>
<div class="verse">Queen of the regne of Pluto dark and lowe</div>
<div class="verse">Goddes of maydens that myn hert has knowe</div>
<div class="verse">Ful many a yeer ye woot what I desire</div>
<div class="verse">As keep me fro the vengeans of thilk yre</div>
<div class="verse">That Actæon aboughte trewely&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Just at this point she heard the
rattling of chariot wheels, and Diana
appeared to her.</p>

<p>‘Well, what do you want now?’ she
said.</p>

<p>‘I don’t want anything in particular,’
said Ernalie in astonishment.</p>

<p>‘Then why did you go on praying
to me like that?’</p>

<p>‘I wasn’t praying, I was reading.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>‘It doesn’t matter to me. It was a
very funny prayer. Whoever was it
by? He must have been a stupid
man.’</p>

<p>‘He was the father of English
poetry,’ the Princess said reproachfully.</p>

<p>‘I should have thought he was a
great-great-grandfather when he wrote
that.’</p>

<p>‘Why?’ said the Princess in astonishment.</p>

<p>‘It seems uncommonly like the
writing of a man in his second childhood.
However, that does not matter.
About the feather now. What can I
do in exchange for it? I will give
you anything you want.’</p>

<p>The Princess looked at the Goddess.</p>

<p>‘Why do you want the feather so
much?’ she asked. ‘Are you not
invisible enough already?’</p>

<p>The Goddess looked at her sneeringly:</p>

<p>‘I <i>am</i> invisible to dull mortals; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
we gods can see each other well
enough, invisible or not. If I had
this feather, though, it would be different,
and I should be able to laugh
at Venus and that set.’</p>

<p>‘Then I’m sure I won’t give it you,
for as Venus is the Goddess of Beauty
she might make me ugly, and that
would not be nice for me.’</p>

<p>Diana laughed.</p>

<p>‘You evidently don’t consider yourself
bad-looking,’ she said; and she
was just going on to say something
else when an enormous wolf, without
a muzzle too, appeared coming round
the side of the Palace.</p>

<p>‘There’s Mars,’ said Diana.</p>

<p>‘I don’t see him. I only see a
horrible wolf, and——’</p>

<p>But the Goddess interrupted her.</p>

<p>‘Why, you stupid, that’s Mars’s wolf,
and where it is Mars is sure to be, or
he isn’t far off.’</p>

<p>‘But what does he want here?’
asked Ernalie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>‘He’s going to escort me to Jupiter’s
ball, and he’ll be awfully impatient.
However, he can wait. Now think, is
there nothing?’</p>

<p>The Princess reflected a moment.</p>

<p>‘If I give it to you,’ she said, ‘you
must do several things for it, and
those quickly.’</p>

<p>The Goddess nodded.</p>

<p>‘First, you must make a road across
the mountains into the country beyond.’</p>

<p>‘That is easy enough,’ said the
Goddess.</p>

<p>‘Then you must kill the dragon.’</p>

<p>‘He died last week of sheer starvation.
So that’s done. Next.’</p>

<p>‘You must bring Treblo here.’</p>

<p>‘Do you mean that he’s to marry
you? That’s too bad, considering that
you know I detest marriages. However,
it can’t be helped. Is that all?
Because if there’s much more you had
better write it down.’</p>

<p>‘There’s nothing more, except that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
it must all be done by half-past six
to-morrow evening.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! is that all? You shall have
it all done before then,’ said the Goddess,
very much relieved that the tasks
that were to be done had been set.</p>

<p>‘Then, if you’re here to-morrow
evening I’ll give it to you.’</p>

<p>Just then Mars appeared round the
corner, looking very bad-tempered.</p>

<p>‘If you <i>are</i> coming at all, you’d
better come at once.’</p>

<p>So Diana said:</p>

<p>‘Very well, to-morrow evening I
shall be here.’</p>

<p>And she drove her chariot towards
the God of War, and when he had got
in they turned the corner of the house
and disappeared.</p>

<p>Just then the King came into the
garden from the library window.</p>

<p>‘What have you been doing?’ he
asked her. ‘I’ve been watching you
for some minutes from the window,
and you’ve been going on in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
most extraordinary manner, talking
and laughing, just as if you had been
speaking to some one.’</p>

<p>The Princess brushed back her hair
from her face.</p>

<p>‘Oh! I didn’t know you could see
me,’ she said. ‘It’s nothing—only a
little surprise I’ve been preparing for
you.’</p>

<p>‘Indeed, you surprise me,’ the King
said.</p>

<p>‘Ah, well! if I do that so easily
perhaps I shall do it often,’ she
said.</p>

<p>‘What have you been doing all the
morning?’ the King asked.</p>

<p>‘All the morning?’ said the Princess
in astonishment. ‘It’s not late,
is it?’</p>

<p>The King pulled out his watch and
looked at it.</p>

<p>‘It’s half-past five by my watch; but
I don’t think that’s quite right—in
fact it stopped three days ago. Ah!
I thought so—there’s the dinner-gong.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
You needn’t wash your hands, or you’ll
be late.’</p>

<p>So they went in together, and the
rest of the day passed off quietly,
except that every now and then one
of the enthusiastic nobles insisted on
coming in and welcoming the Princess,
although the King had given strict
orders that no one should be admitted,
as he wanted to be alone for the day.
In spite of this, every now and then
an elderly duchess <i>would</i> rush into the
royal presence, and offer her congratulations.</p>

<p>At last, just as they hoped that the
last of them had come and gone, the
door opened, and an elderly man—he
would have been offended at being
called old—rushed in and clasped the
Princess in his arms.</p>

<p>‘My adored Duchess——’ he was
just beginning.</p>

<p>But the Princess boxed his ears
suddenly, and he let go.</p>

<p>‘What on earth does this mean?’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
she said, turning to the King. ‘First
I am inundated with duchesses until
I’m quite tired of the name, and then
this old fright rushes in and calls me
<i>his</i> duchess, when I’m not a duchess
at all. What does he mean, papa?’</p>

<p>The King looked rather embarrassed.</p>

<p>‘It’s one of them,’ he said meaningly.</p>

<p>‘Oh! it’s one of them, is it?’ she
said. ‘Well, sir’—turning to the Duke—‘what
do <i>you</i> mean by forcing your
way here against the royal orders?’</p>

<p>‘I thought,’ said the Duke, looking
rather foolish, ‘that as you are going
to——’</p>

<p>‘But I’m not,’ said Ernalie suddenly,
‘after such rudeness. You may go,
and don’t come back again.’</p>

<p>And the Duke went.</p>

<p>‘That’s got rid of one of them, at
any rate,’ the King said, with a sigh of
relief.</p>

<p>‘I’ll do my best to get rid of them
all,’ said the Princess.</p>

<p>‘How?’ the King began. Then he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
stopped. ‘Wait a moment. I have
an idea,’ he went on.</p>

<p>‘Indeed, you surprise me,’ said the
Princess.</p>

<p>But the King did not notice her
impertinent remark. He went to a
drawer, and took out a large piece
of paper, and wrote on it as large as
he could:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<div class="center">‘NOTICE.</div>

<p>‘During the next twenty-four hours,
any one found kissing, embracing, congratulating,
or suing for the hand of
the Princess—or King—will be submerged
three times in the Palace
draw-well.</p>

<div class="sig">
‘(Signed) <span class="smcap">Caret</span>, etc. etc.’<br />
</div></div>

<p>‘That ought to do it,’ said the King,
surveying his handiwork approvingly.</p>

<p>Just then the door opened, and
two more old gentlemen—each wearing
a ducal coronet—tottered in as
fast as they could.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>‘My dear Princess,’ ‘My darling
wife,’ they duetted in feeble tones,
showing as much joy as their faces
were capable of, which made them
look about as pleasant as a pair of
Japanese masks.</p>

<p>‘Allow me to congratulate you,’
‘Allow me to offer my congratulations,’
they went on.</p>

<p>‘Now you’ve done it,’ said the King.
‘Look here!’ And he showed them
the notice.</p>

<p>The two Dukes turned each a different
shade of yellow.</p>

<p>‘But, your Majesty,’ one of them
began.</p>

<p>‘But, your Majesty,’ said the other
suddenly; ‘as I’m——’</p>

<p>‘As I’m——’ the other put in.</p>

<p>Each of them stopped and looked
angrily at the other.</p>

<p>‘As the son-in-law elect of the King,’
the first one began.</p>

<p>‘As the affianced husband of the
Princess,’ said the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I think I have the right to speak
first,’ they both said angrily.</p>

<p>But the King said, coolly:</p>

<p>‘My lords, the case is very clear.
You have each of you offended against
the law by congratulating the Princess,
and as one of you, if not both, intends
to marry my daughter and become
King, it is as well to teach you from
the beginning that the law must be
abided by. Therefore, you will be
ducked—“submerged,” the notice
says—until one of you expires; the
other will then marry Ernalie, and in
course of time—if he does not die of
the effects in the meantime—he will
ascend the throne, having learnt a
useful lesson.’</p>

<p>As the Dukes got greener and
greener at this, the King went on:</p>

<p>‘The sentence had better be executed
at once, so come along to the
courtyard.’</p>

<p>‘But, your Majesty,’ said one of
them, ‘I am subject to rheumatism,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
and I should not be fit to reign if
this immersion in cold water should
make it so bad that I was unable to
move.’</p>

<p>‘That’s just the case with me,’ said
the other.</p>

<p>‘Ah, well, if that is so,’ said the
King, ‘perhaps you would like to give
up your pretensions to my daughter’s
hand. In that case, I should let you
off, because there would be no need
to give you such a practical exemplification
of the majesty of the law.’</p>

<p>The Dukes looked perplexedly at
one another.</p>

<p>‘I think,’ said one of them, ‘that,
under the circumstances, I will give
up my pretensions to the Princess’s
hand.’</p>

<p>Here he looked regretfully at her
right hand.</p>

<p>‘And I too,’ said the other sadly,
looking at her left hand.</p>

<p>‘How <i>very</i> gallant of you,’ the
Princess said ironically. ‘And now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
as you’ve got rid of me so easily,
perhaps you will be so kind as to leave
us for a time. Good-day.’</p>

<p>‘Good-day,’ duetted the Dukes.</p>

<p>And they huddled out as well as
they could, each trying to get behind
the other.</p>

<p>‘I think that’s got rid of all the
suitors for to-day,’ the King said when
the door closed behind them. ‘I’ll
just go and have the notice hung
on the door, and I’ll be back in a
minute.’</p>

<p>And he went, too.</p>

<p>Now really, he thought he had let
the Dukes off too easily, and he
intended to catch them up and fine
them, but they had made off so uncommonly
fast that they had disappeared
before he got to the street
door.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Princess waited
quietly for him; but hearing a noise
of wheels outside the window, she went
to see what was the cause of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Why, it’s him!’ she said delightedly,
and with utter disregard
of English grammar.</p>

<p>Opening the window she called out,
‘Treblo! Treblo!’ and, running down
the steps towards him, threw herself
into his arms.</p>

<p>For a moment she was too much
out of breath to say anything at all,
and Treblo too surprised to do anything
but just hold her in his arms;
and the King, who had just returned
from the search after the Dukes, was
far too taken aback to do anything
but stand with his mouth and eyes
wide open.</p>

<p>‘I call this too bad,’ he said in a low
voice; and then raising it, he called out:</p>

<p>‘Young man, I say, have you seen
the notice?’</p>

<p>Treblo looked annoyed.</p>

<p>‘What is the notice to me, you old
fool?’ he said.</p>

<p>The King looked more and more
astonished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>‘This is too much,’ he said. ‘Ernalie,
when you’ve done kissing that
young man perhaps you’ll tell me
who he is. You see, it’s no use
my putting up notices about other
people embracing you if you go and
perform on some one immediately
afterwards. Now just tell me who
it is.’</p>

<p>‘Why, it’s him, papa,’ said Ernalie,
who had by this time disengaged
herself.</p>

<p>‘Oh, it’s a <i>him</i>, is it?’ the King
said. ‘That’s what the three others
said they were, but they wouldn’t suit
you.’</p>

<p>‘But they were so very old; besides,
this is <i>the</i> him, papa.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, I see,’ said the papa, laughing.
‘It’s a case of “Ancient and Modern
Hymns,” and you prefer the modern.
But what about the notice?’</p>

<p>‘What <i>is</i> the notice?’ asked Treblo,
rather puzzled; ‘and what has it got
to do with me?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>‘More than you think,’ said the
King. ‘It’s worth reading, I can
tell you, especially during the next
twenty-four hours. I should advise
you to learn it by heart—that is, if
you intend. However, I’ll go and
fetch it, and you will be able to see
for yourself.’</p>

<p>And the King went off to look
for his notice.</p>

<p>When he had gone, the Princess
said:</p>

<p>‘But how did you get here? I
thought the mountains could not be
crossed.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know anything about the
mountains, or how I came here either,
for that matter. All I know is that
I was suddenly caught up in a thick
mist which hid me from every one,
and every one from me too, and before
I knew anything I was whirled
off here in about a minute and a
half, and then you came running down
the steps—and that’s all I know.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
Now perhaps you’ll tell me where I
am, for I haven’t the faintest idea?’</p>

<p>‘Why, you’re in the middle of the
kingdom of Aoland, and that was my
father, and this is my home—and it’s
all right.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, it’s all right now, but you
wouldn’t have said it was all right if
you had been carried like me.’</p>

<p>‘But you should feel yourself highly
honoured and not injured. Why, you
stupid fellow, it was a goddess who
was carrying you like the heroes of
Homer.’</p>

<p>‘A goddess!’ said the Prince, laughing.
‘Why, you must have been
the goddess, Ernalie, and you’re
quite——’</p>

<p>But the Princess stopped him.</p>

<p>‘What’s the use of saying that if
you won’t believe me? It really was
a goddess; and if you would like
to know her name, it was Diana.’</p>

<p>‘Diana!’ said the Prince. ‘Why
did she carry me off like this?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Because I told her to, of course.’</p>

<p>The Prince shook his head.</p>

<p>‘Come, I say, Ernalie,’ he said, ‘this
is too much, you know. I suppose you
want me to believe that?’</p>

<p>‘Of course I do. Why should I
have told you if I hadn’t wanted
you to?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, that’s all very well,’ said the
unbelieving Prince; ‘but how do you
do it?’</p>

<p>‘I just make myself invisible, and
then I make people do everything I
like; they have to do it, or else I
tease them till they do. But let’s
come into the house and I’ll tell you
all about it. But why are you holding
me so tightly?’</p>

<p>‘I am afraid that you will suddenly
vanish as you did once before, and
I don’t want that—you’ve been away
from me long enough.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, but I won’t leave you again,
Treblo,’ she said, ‘I promise that—that
is, if you don’t want me to.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Then you won’t leave me, dear?’
he said; ‘for I shall never want to
lose sight of you again.’</p>

<p>So they went in, and the Princess
told him what you know already—if
you haven’t skipped it. But all the
same he did not leave go of her,
and I don’t think it was from mistrust.</p>

<p>Ernalie finished relating her story,
and the Prince was beginning:</p>

<p>‘My dearest Ernalie, how can I——’
when the door opened, and the
King came in.</p>

<p>‘I’ve had such a job,’ he said, wiping
his forehead. ‘There were about
three thousand people assembled reading
the notice, and they jeered and
hooted so much that I had to make
them a speech before they’d go away.
However, here’s the notice.’</p>

<p>The Prince read it through carefully,
and when he had finished he looked
at the King and said:</p>

<p>‘Well?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>‘That’s just it,’ said the King; ‘the
Palace draw-<i>well</i>.’</p>

<p>‘But as I’m the affianced bride
of—I mean, as Ernalie’s my future
husband——’</p>

<p>‘That’s just what the other two
said—at least they said, and more
correctly, that they were my sons-in-law
elect; only that didn’t help
them.’</p>

<p>By this time the Prince was looking
more puzzled than ever.</p>

<p>‘Who are these other two?’ he said,
turning to the Princess.</p>

<p>(‘Beware of the green-eyed monster,’
the King said parenthetically.)</p>

<p>‘Oh, they’re only three dukes that
papa had promised my hand to—only
I wouldn’t have them.’</p>

<p>‘You mean they wouldn’t have you,’
said the King, correcting her.</p>

<p>‘I don’t mean anything of the sort,’
said the Princess.</p>

<p>‘Oh, very well, my dear,’ said the
King. ‘Of course, if you say so,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
it’s all right. But how about the
notice?’</p>

<p>‘I think we’ll tear that up,’ said
Ernalie. ‘It’s done its duty, and it
will be rather in the way now.’</p>

<p>‘Indeed, you surprise me,’ remarked
the King.</p>

<p>‘Ernalie is quite right,’ said the
Prince.</p>

<p>‘Oh! is she?’ said the King.
‘Then I suppose I’d better tear it
up.’ And he did.</p>

<p>When he had finished, and had
thrown the fragments into the waste-paper
basket, he said:</p>

<p>‘Now I suppose you want me to
consent to your marrying each other,
and I suppose I’d better, or else I
shall have Ernalie pitching into me
like anything—only, I really don’t
know who you are, young man, except
that Ernalie says you are “him” (she
ought to say he), and so I suppose
you are Treblo, the Prince of the
neighbouring kingdom?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I am,’ said the Prince. ‘And I
suppose you are the King of this
country?’</p>

<p>The King was just about to say
‘I am,’ when another voice sounded
through the room so clear and commanding
that each of them looked
towards the window from which it
came; but nothing was to be seen
there.</p>

<p>‘The road is made,’ it said, ‘and
now perhaps you’ll give me the
feather.’</p>

<p>‘Certainly,’ said the Princess. ‘Here
it is,’ and she held it out in the
direction of the Goddess. ‘Only,
you might let us see you before you
go for ever.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, certainly,’ said the Goddess,
for, to tell the truth, Diana—like others
besides goddesses—was very fond of
being admired; and immediately she
appeared in the middle of the room
with her silver bow and quiver slung
over her back, and the star that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
always wore shining on her forehead.</p>

<p>She took the feather and, smiling,
put it to her hair, and on the moment
passed away; so that, where she
had seemed to be, they saw the thin
circlet of the moon hanging silvery
and pale over the flush of the sun’s
departure.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>‘It really was Diana,’ Treblo
said.</p>

<p>‘Yes, of course it was, you sceptical
boy,’ Ernalie answered; and then, with
a little sigh, ‘I wish I had the feather
still, it makes me feel just like any
other girl being without it.’</p>

<p>‘But you’re not—not a bit—there’s
no one like you in the world!’ Treblo
said hotly.</p>

<p>‘Why, I believe you’re right—upon
my word I do,’ the King said suddenly,
looking up from a book in which he
had seemed immersed, ‘<i>I</i> never knew
any one like her—for obstinacy.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Let’s go into the garden, Treblo,’
the Princess said.</p>

<p>‘You’ll catch your deaths of cold,’
the King remarked.</p>

<p>But somehow, although they quietly
ignored his prudent observation, which
was really wrong of them, they never
caught cold. And that is all the
stranger, because the evening was falling
very rapidly, with a feeling of cool
dew after the heat of the day, with
a faint scent of roses and honeysuckle,
and no sound on the air but the
splash of a fish as it jumped for a
moment out of the smooth river, or
the short, shrill shriek of a bat that
was circling in the air above them.
They sat in a marble niche in the
wall that had roses running up it
and hanging down like a net in front
of them—sat and talked till it grew
so dark that he could no longer see
the golden threads in her brown hair;
until he could no longer see that her
eyes were hazel-gray and long-lashed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
or even that her face was a long,
sweet, serious oval. So, you see, it
must have been <i>quite</i> a long time that
they sat and talked thus.</p>

<p>But from this you are not to
imagine that their example is to be
emulated—not by any means; because
I am perfectly certain that if
any one were foolish enough to do
it nowadays, they’d have perfectly
miserable colds-in-the-head at the very
least, not to mention rheumatic pains,
so I should really advise you not to
try any such tricks; very likely the
Prince and Princess had something
especial to keep them warm, or perhaps
they sat rather close together—it’s
just possible.</p>

<p>However, next morning the Prince
and Princess set out together for the
court of King Abbonamento.</p>

<p>They arrived safely at the Palace,
and were received with joy by every
one—except Mumkie, who was already
making preparations to make himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
King again, for he was quite sure that
the Prince had been carried off for
good. So, when he saw the Prince
returning, safe and sound, he was
seized with such a fit of rage that he
jumped into the sea, and swam right
out of sight. Wopole having, moreover,
committed the fatal mistake of
setting sail from the moon when it set,
had unfortunately chosen the wrong
side of the earth. And from that day
to this neither he nor Mumkie has
ever been heard more of.</p>

<p>But in a very short time the Prince
and Princess were married, and it is
needless to say—because, since we live
in the nineteenth century, no one will
believe it, but still, if you’ll take my
word for it—they lived happily ever
afterwards.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
